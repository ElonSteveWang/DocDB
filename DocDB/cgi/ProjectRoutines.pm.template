# A global variable $Public is used to (when set) remove elements from the
# nav-bars that the public has no interest in. The variable is global
# and can control the style of your headers and footers too.

sub DocDBHeader {

# This routine is reponsible for whatever you want to put as a header on the
# page.
# 
# $Title is for the <title> element while $PageTitle is the title of the page
# you may put in the text of the page. For $Search == 1, its necessary to put
# the onload event into the body tag to get the updating selection boxes
# on the search page. 
#
# The simplest possible routine should look something like this:

  unless ($PageTitle) {
    $PageTitle = $Title;

  print "<head>\n";
  print "<title>$Title</title>\n";

# This routine is reponsible for whatever you want to put as a footer on the
# page. 
#
# Parameters are supplied for the name and e-mail address of the person
# responsible for the pages
#
# The simplest possible routine should look something like this:
