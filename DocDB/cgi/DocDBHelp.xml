  <title>Short tutorial on groups</title>
  <text>
Access to documents within the DocDB is controlled in several ways. A document
may be tagged as accessible to a subset of groups. Additionally, each group may
have a list of subordinate groups. Anything marked viewable by a subordinate is
also viewable by its superior group. (This relationship does not extend to more
than one generation, though.)<p/> Each group also has a flag determining
whether that group is allowed to create new  or modify existing documents. If a
group is in the list of those allowed to modify a  document, it can change that
document (assuming they also have the create/modify flag set). These group
names must match those in the <b>.htpasswd</b> file although the comparison is
not case sensitive.

 <entry>
<key>filename</key>

 <entry>
<key>dynamictopic</key>
<title>Topics</title>
  <text>
Using this control you can select either topics or sub-topics for the
document(s) you are searching for. You can select topics on the left and
sub-topics on the right. Selecting a topic on the left will limit your choices
on the right (assuming you have Javascript turned on). 
<p/>
Selecting any sub-topic on the right ignore its parent topic on the left. 
This means that if you have <i>Meetings</i> and
<i>Detectors</i>
selected on the left and <i>Detectors:Straws</i> selected on the right, your
search will be performed on <i>Detectors:Straws</i> and <i>Meetings</i>. But,
even if you have "OR" selected for "Within Fields," you won't get documents for
detectors other than straws.

 <entry>
<key>wordsearch</key>
<title>Text Searches</title>
  <text>
These fields allow you to search on the various text items in the database.
The following modes are used to search for information:
<ul>
 <li><b>Any words as sub-string: </b>The information you enter is broken into
 words (delimited by spaces) and the field you are searching in is required to
 match one or more of these words as a substring (<i>lock</i> will match
 <i>lock</i> and <i>block</i>).</li>
 <li><b>All words as sub-string: </b>The information you enter is broken into
 words (delimited by spaces) and the field you are searching in is required to
 match all of these words as substrings (in any order).</li> 
 <li><b>Any or all words as words: </b>Like the searches above, but spaces are 
 require to delimit words (<i>lock</i> will not match <i>block</i>).</li> 
</ul> 
  </text>
 </entry>

<entry>
 <key>contentsearch</key>
 <title>File content search</title>
 <text>
  This field uses an external search engine to search for strings in the files 
  in the document. Whether it matches sub-strings or whole words is a function 
  of the external search engine. Note that not all document formats are 
  searchable. (Searches in text and HTML files will be most reliable.)
  </text>
 </entry>

 <entry>
<key>logictype</key>
<title>Between Fields vs. Within Fields</title>
  <text>
Two types of logic can be used to refine your search. <p/>

The setting for <b>Between Fields</b> lets you select AND or OR between
elements on the form. For instance, if you select and Author and a Topic, you
can either find documents by that author AND on that topic or by that author OR
on that topic. AND is the default.<p/>

The setting for <b>Within Fields</b> determines what happens when, for instance,
you select two authors. You can either require that both authors are present on
the paper (AND) or either author is present (OR). OR is the
default. Note that this setting
doesn't apply to text searches (since they use their own syntax). Also, for
Submitter and Document Type, multiple settings on the document are not
possible, so these searches are <b>always</b> done with an OR. 
  </text>
 </entry>

 <entry>
<key>keywords</key>
<title>Keywords</title>
  <text>
   Keywords are used to further classify documents below the sub-topic level.

<key>replacefiles</key>
<title>Replace Duplicate Files</title>
  <text>
If you select this option, any files you add which duplicate file names of
existing files will completely replace the old files (no backup will be kept).
Do <strong>not</strong> use this option to avoid creating a new version of a
document, even if only minor changes have been made. This option is, instead,
intended for making minor fixes to presentation formats and the like.  Disk
space is cheap, mistakes are not.
<p/>
Please use this option responsibly.

     match means that for people who share a last name, the first name must
     be fully specified. Entered middle initials are ignored.

you are going to write, but don't have a draft of the document.</li>
<li>New document: You have a new document ready to be put into the database that

<li>Update document: You have a new version of a document already in the
database. You will also be able to change any of the information in the database
about the document. You must supply a document number to modify.</li>
<li>Update database information: The document hasn't changed, but the
information about it has. For example, it's now published so you want to add that
information. You must supply a document number to modify.</li>
<li>Add/Replace files: You forgot a file that belongs with the document or
something minor has changed in one of the files.<p/>Replacing files should be done
with caution since no backup is kept. Please do not use this capability to
avoid creating a new version of a document when that is more appropriate. Disk

  <title>Breaks and Events</title>
  <text>
   Check this box if your entry is a break between sessions. These
   <q>sessions</q> cannot have talks or documents associated with them. You
   might use such a separator between sessions to denote a coffee break, a
   meal, or another activity. 
   <p/>
   There are also separators you can use between <i>talks</i> to indicate
   breaks in the agenda for lunch or coffee. (These are inserted as you
   designate talks <i>within</i> a session.) Which type to use where depends
   on the organization of your meeting. </text>

  <text>
   <p><strong>Confirm:</strong> Check this box if DocDB has guessed the talk
   correctly based on the agenda information. Also check this box if you
   manually enter a document number in the "Doc. #" box. If you fail to do
   this, DocDB will try to guess again,  possibly erasing your change.</p>

   <p><strong>Delete:</strong> Check this box to delete a talk from the agenda. A document associated with
   the talk (if any) will <b>not</b> be deleted, just the agenda entry.</p>

   <p><strong>Reserve:</strong> Check this box to create a new document based
   on the  information entered in the agenda. The submitter of the document is
   listed as the first author and the document is modifiable by anyone who can
   <i>view</i> the meeting. You must supply at least one author for the
   document.</p>

   <p><strong>Break:</strong> Check this box to create a break (e.g. for coffee) 
   rather than a talk in the agenda.</p>

   For each document, select the fields you want displayed and their position. 
   For instance, column 2 row 1 will be to the right of column 1, row 1 while
   column 1, row 2 will be displayed below. The Row(s) and Column(s) settings
   allow larger fields to span several rows or  columns (these are equivalent to
   rowspan and colspan in HTML.)  If not laid out correctly, this can
   cause strange looking lists.
