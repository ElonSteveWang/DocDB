#        Name: EmailAdminister 
# Description: This script is called by EmailAdministerForm and does 
#              administration on users who have signed up for email from the
#              DB. Since users can change almost everything, it really just
#              deletes users and changes their passwords in case they forget.
#              It also displays all the users and their notification 
#              preferences.
