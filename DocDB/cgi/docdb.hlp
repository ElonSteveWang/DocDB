#
overdatepref

Use this option if you want to (by default) be able to set the date and time
for documents written in the past. This is useful mainly for those entering
lots of old documents.
#
namepref
Name
Select your name from the list. When you create a new document, you will be
automatically selected as the requester and author.
#
displaymode
Sort by
This controls how the list of documents is sorted and what is shown on the
one-line summary of the document. "By Date" is usually used for generic
documents and "By Author" is useful for meetings.
#
filename
File Name
When updating the database information on a document, you can't rename the
files, but you can redescribe them. These are the names of the files in your
document.
#
dynamictopic
Topics
Using this control you can select either topics or sub-topics for the
document(s) you are searching for. You can select topics on the left and
sub-topics on the right. Selecting a topic on the left will limit your choices
on the right (assuming you have Javascript turned on). 
<p>
Selecting any sub-topic on the right ignore its parent topic on the left. 
This means that if you have <i>Meetings</i> and
<i>Detectors</i>
selected on the left and <i>Detectors:Straws</i> selected on the right, your
search will be performed on <i>Detectors:Straws</i> and <i>Meetings</i>. But,
even if you have "OR" selected for "Within Fields," you won't get documents for
detectors other than straws.  
#
beforeafterdate
Last Modified Between
Use these two menus to select a date range for the document(s) you are looking
for. You can leave either the start or end completely blank for an open ended
search. <p>
You can also leave months and/or days blank on one or both menus to perform
searches between the beginning and end of years and months (whichever is
appropriate). Unpredictable
results may occur if, for instance, you leave the month blank but select a day
of the month.
#
doctypemulti
Document Type
Select the types of documents you are looking for. Note that regardless of the
setting of <b>Within Fields</b> this search will be performed with a logical
OR.
#
requestersearch
Requester
Select the people who might have initially requested or requested a modification
to the document you are looking for. Note that regardless of the setting of
<b>Within Fields</b> this search will be performed with a logical OR.
#
wordsearch
Text Searches
These fields allow you to search on the various text items in the database.
The following modes are used to search for information:
<ul>
 <li><b>Any words as sub-string: </b>The information you enter is broken into
 words (delimited by spaces) and the field you are searching in is required to
 match one or more of these words as a substring (<i>lock</i> will match
 <i>lock</i> and <i>block</i>).
 <li><b>All words as sub-string: </b>The information you enter is broken into
 words (delimited by spaces) and the field you are searching in is required to
 match all of these words as substrings (in any order). 
</ul> 
#
logictype
Between Fields vs. Within Fields
Two types of logic can be used to refine your search. <p>

The setting for <b>Between Fields</b> lets you select AND or OR between
elements on the form. For instance, if you select and Author and a Topic, you
can either find documents by that author AND on that topic or by that author OR
on that topic. AND is the default.<p>

The setting for <b>Within Fields</b> determines what happens when, for instance,
you select two authors. You can either require that both authors are present on
the paper (AND) or either author is present (OR). OR is the
default. Note that this setting
doesn't apply to text searches (since they use their own syntax). Also, for
Requester and Document Type, multiple settings on the document are not
possible, so these searches are <b>always</b> done with an OR. 
#
keywords
Keywords
Keywords are used to further classify documents below the sub-topic level.
Keywords should be seperated by spaces. Compound words should use a dash or
under-score to connect words. While
there is no centrally managed list of keywords, the following groups have
defined their own set of keywords for their documents:
<ul>
<li><a target="keywords" href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/atwork/detector/pixel/meetings.shtml">Pixel
Detector<a/>
</ul>
If other groups have done the same, let the <a
href="mailto:btev-docdb@fnal.gov">DocDB adminstrators</a> know so we can include
a link to your set of keywords here too.
#
replacefiles
Replace Duplicate Files
If you select this option, any files you add which duplicate file names of
existing files will completely replace the old files (no backup will be kept). Yuu

document, even if only minor changes have been made. This option is, instead,
intended for making minor fixes to presentation formats and the like. 
Disk space is cheap, mistakes are not.
<p>
Please use this option responsibly.
