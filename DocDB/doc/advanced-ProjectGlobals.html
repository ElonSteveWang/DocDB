<p>
While the default instructions suggest putting a self-contained
ProjectGlobals.pm file in each directory where DocDB scripts reside, that can be
a hassle if you have more than a couple of such diretories, especially if you
have several instances of DocDB running on the same server but using different
MySQL directories.
</p>

<p>
This page is intended to give some examples on how one might break the
ProjectGlobals.pm file up and use the perl "require" statement to build a
modular, more easily maintaind ProjectGlobals.pm. We will use
ProjectGlobals.pm.template as an example.
</p>

<p>
First, lets split up the file into parts in common for the Project and the
Server. Well set things up so that we have some default settings in the Server
file and then let the project file over-ride them. You can and should keep this
files OUTSIDE of the area served by the web server.
</p>

<p><b>ServerCommon.pm:</b></p>

<pre>
$db_host       = "db-server-host-and-domain";
$db_rwuser     = "docdbrw";             # This may or may not be common on you setup
$db_rouser     = "docdbro";             # ditto
$MailServer       = "smtp-server-host-name";

$LastDays             = 20;    # Number of days for default in LastModified
$HomeLastDays         = 7;     # Number of days for last modified on home page
$HomeMaxDocs          = 50;    # Maximum number of documents on home page
$MeetingWindow        = 7;     # Days before and after meeting to preselect
$TalkHintWindow       = 7;     # Days before and after to guess on documents
$MeetingFiles         = 3;     # Number of upload boxes on meeting short form
$InitialSessions      = 5;     # Number of initial sessions when making meeting

#$Wget   = "/usr/bin/wget -O - --quiet ";
#$Tar    = "";                     # Set this if you don't have GNU tar
#$GTar   = "/bin/tar ";            # Set this if you do have GNU tar (e.g. Linux)
#$GZip   = "/bin/gzip ";           # Currently only needed if non-GNU tar
#$GUnzip = "/bin/gunzip ";         # Currently only needed if non-GNU tar
#$Unzip  = "/usr/bin/unzip -q ";
#$Zip    = "/usr/bin/zip -q -r ";  # Set to "" in ProjectGlobals if not installed

# Set up some common features/options/settings for everyone

$FirstYear      = 2000;           # Earliest year that documents can be created
$UseSignoffs          = 0;     # Sign-off system for document approval
$MailInstalled        = 1;     # Is the Mailer::Mail module installed?
#$DefaultPublicAccess  = 0;     # New documents are public by default
</pre>

Now let's look at the project file:

<p><b>ProjectFooCommon.pm:</b></p>

<pre>
require "/full/path/to/ServerCommon.pm";

# These are needed

$db_name       = "DocDB";               
$db_rwpass     = "read-write-password"; # Usernames defined above 
$db_ropass     = "read-only-password";  

# Root directories and URLs

$file_root   = "/www/html/DocDB/";    
$script_root = "/www/cgi-bin/DocDB/"; 
$web_root    = "http://web-server-host-and-domain/DocDB/";
$cgi_root    = "http://web-server-host-and-domain/cgi-bin/DocDB/";
$cgi_path    = "/cgi-bin/DocDB/"; # Used for cookies

# Name and e-mail address of the administrators (or mailing list for admins)

$DBWebMasterEmail = "docdb\@mail-gateway";
$DBWebMasterName  = "Document Database Administrators";

$AuthUserFile     = "/full/path/to/.htpasswd";
$Project        = "My Project";
$ShortProject   = "MyProject";    # This is the project used in the Document ID

# Now lets change a couple of things for this project

$LastDays       = 7;    # Number of days for default in LastModified
$FirstYear      = 1990;           # Earliest year that documents can be created
</pre>

<p>
Now let's look at three hypothetical files that actually go in the
cgi-directories. They will implement a DB with read-write certificate
authorization, read-only http-basic authorization, and a public setting
</p>

<p><b>ProjectGlobals.pm: (Public)</b></p>

<pre>
require "/full/path/to/ProjectFooCommon.pm";

$Public = 1;
$remote_user      = ""; # Just to be safe
$RemoteUsername   = ""; # Just to be safe
$db_rwuser        = ""; # Just to be safe
$db_rwpass        = ""; # Just to be safe

$WelcomeMessage = "Welcome to the public portion of the $Project Document
                   Database,<br/> the repository for all $Project public talks, proceedings, preprints, and publications.";

# Need to change these to point at right places

$script_root = "/www/cgi-bin/DocDB-public/"; 
$cgi_root    = "http://web-server-host-and-domain/cgi-bin/DocDB-public/";
$cgi_path    = "/cgi-bin/DocDB-public/"; # Used for cookies
</pre>

<p><b>ProjectGlobals.pm: (Certificate)</b></p>

<pre>
require "/full/path/to/ProjectFooCommon.pm";

$WelcomeMessage = "Welcome to the $Project Document Database, the repository for all $Project documents.";

$UserValidation = "certificate";
$Preferences{Security}{Certificates}{UseCNOnly} = $TRUE; # For DOE certs, use CN instead of E (E-mail) to distinguish

# Need to change these to point at right places

$script_root = "/www/cgi-bin/DocDB-certificate/"; 
$cgi_root    = "https://web-server-host-and-domain/cgi-bin/DocDB-certificate/";
$cgi_path    = "/cgi-bin/DocDB-certificate/"; # Used for cookies
</pre>

<p><b>ProjectGlobals.pm: (Read Only)</b></p>

<pre>
require "/full/path/to/ProjectFooCommon.pm";

$WelcomeMessage = "You can browse with the group username and password, but not
upload documents or change meta-data";

$ReadOnly = 1;

# May need to change these to point at right places depending on what is in
# Project-common

$script_root = "/www/cgi-bin/DocDB/"; 
$cgi_root    = "http://web-server-host-and-domain/cgi-bin/DocDB/";
$cgi_path    = "/cgi-bin/DocDB/"; # Used for cookies
</pre>

<p>
<b>Even more advanced usage:</b> You could store all the CSS files and JS files
in one web-accessible location and set the variables <tt>$CSSDirectory</tt>,
<tt>$CSSURLPath</tt>, <tt>$JSDirectory</tt>, and <tt>$JSURLPath</tt> to point at that
place. You can set this in server common. You could also set most of common
parts of the paths for script root, cgi_root, file_root, etc. in the
ServerCommon.pm and then just add the differences in the relevant files. This
lets you move things around easily.
