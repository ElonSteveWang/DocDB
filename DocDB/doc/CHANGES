7.1.1

From a user standpoint, not much is really new. There is a link from the agenda
creation pages to the event documentation. On the list of authors, they are
broken up by last name and if enough authors are entered (>40 currently) there
are anchor links to help find the right author.

On running DocumentAddForm a unique ID is generated which is stored in the
Document table. ProcessDocumentAdd checks that this doesn't exist, so that
reloading the document result form will no longer generate a duplicate
document.

Also bugs fixed in Searching by document type and administration of External
DocDBs. Finally, there are some code cleanups.

7.1.0

This release adds one major function. The "Related Documents" field now accepts 
specific versions of documents (123-v4 always links to the 4th version instead
of the latest) and you can also link to versions in *other* DocDB instances. To
do this, you have to make your DocDB aware of other DocDBs with the admin
interface and then use documents like BTeV-140-v1 (the v4 is optional, of
course). This will create a link to the correct BTeV document.

Also, there are instructions for the event organizer and the calendar available.

There were also some bugs fixed along the way and some tweaks made to the event
manager.

7.0.0

Version 7 introduces some new functionality and a lot of clean-ups under the
hood. It also requires a couple of new perl modules. Install this from CPAN or
from RPMs. See cpan.html in doc/ for pointers.  To get these from CPAN, do
this:

> setenv LANG en_US # Get's rid of UTF8 from RedHat
> perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install File::MimeInfo
cpan> install DateTime::Format::MySQL
cpan> install DateTime (probably not needed)

You also have to install the shared-mime-info package. If your system doesn't
have it, you can get it from:

http://freedesktop.org/Software/shared-mime-info

The Fedora Core 2 RPM seems to work fine on Scientific Linux 3.0.x. If you don't
get this installed correctly, RetrieveFile may give the wrong MIME type. In your
webserver error logs you may see messages from DocDB. DocDB will still try to 
figure out the MIME type of the files served using the Unix "file" command.

The Document Type (Talk/Figure/etc.) is now changable

Meetings/events (we now try to use the word "events" consistently) are no longer
topics, they are a completely parallel way to organize documents. This
alleviates the presentation problems when the number of events in an event
group (the old special MajorTopics) gets large compared to the number of topics
or when the number of Event Groups gets large. Your existing MajorTopics that
are marked as special in ProjectGlobals will be migrated to the new scheme.

There is now a calendar that shows events. Expect this to improve and grow (and
ask me if you want a pref to turn it off). 

There is a directory to store javascript files instead of having the JS we need
printed out by DocDB.

Migration instructions:

0) Back-up your database (do a mysqldump command)
1) Check out the new stable distribution in a fresh area
2) Copy MigrateV7 into an area where you can run *version 6* scripts. The
   cgi-bin will work, but make sure you delete it after you do this to prevent 
   it being run from the web.
3) Run MigrateV7 in init mode
4) Run MigrateV7 in migrate mode
5) Upgrade the DocDB code (cvs update -r stable)
6) Go to your html/Static directory and do "cvs update -d -r stable" This will 
   create and update a bunch of CSS files as well as create a new "js" directory
   where Javascript files are stored.
7) Edit your site specific CSS files if needed. (There is a new shaded    
   element "tbody.Odd" that will be grey by default.)
8) Make sure everything works, make sure your events were migrated correctly.
9) Run  MigrateV7 in delete mode  

Links to "Collaboration Meetings" and "Conferences" have been removed from the
homepage. If you would like to put them back .... 

New web scripts added: EventAdministerForm  
                       ShowCalendar 
                       
Version 7 also has tables for future functionality to follow in point releases:

1) Customizing which fields are shown in lists of documents and lists of talks 
2) Cross-referencing specific versions of documents and version in *other*
   DocDB's
3) Eliminating people re-loading the document creation form and creating
   duplicate documents.   

Finally, the links to Conferences and Collaboration meetings have been removed.
ProjectMessages.pm.template shows how you can restore these or other such lists
for your instance to the DocDB Homepage

6.6.2

There are now basic instructions for the Public (you need to make link to DocDBInstructions in public
instance)

Apply style to DocDBHelp (help popups). Popups have "class=PopUp" and normal
pages have "class=normal" so that you can apply different CSS files to both.

Changed AddDocument API, now returns ($DocumentID,$DocRevisionID). Use
"($DocumentID) = " rather than "$DocumentID = " now. Can also specify Document #
with "-docid => $id"


6.6.0

Two major changes: First, the instructions are now printed with a script rather
than HTML. If you have $HelpFile defined in ProjectGlobals, please remove it, 
it is no longer necessary. The instructions will now also include your project 
name, point at your URLs, etc. They should not need to be edited.

The second change applies to certificate based authentication only. There is a new 
option in the left "menu" of both the main page and the "Change" page that allows a 
user to only act as certain groups that they belong to. In other words, if your 
certificate lets you act as an administrator and a normal user, you can turn off the 
admin abilities until you need them.

6.5.0

In certificate mode or optionally, by setting
$Preferences{Options}{AlwaysRetrieveFile} all files are retrieved via
RetrieveFile which streams the file directly to the user. This has the benefit
of not requiring separate passwords from the user while probably being a little
slower. 

6.3.0 

By default, certificate authorization uses the e-mail address in a client
certificate to determine if it is unique. Some certificate providers don't
encode an e-mail address. In that case, you can set
$Preferences{Security}{Certificates}{UseCNOnly} = TRUE to use the CN instead.

Also, adds indicators of required fields to the meeting entry form and fixes a
few small bugs discovered by FNAL-CD.

6.2 

Allows people with personal accounts to monitor specific documents, not just
based on authors, topics, or keywords. At the bottom of the left column you will
see a place to type your username and password to watch a document. You can
erase the list of watched documents from the "Manage a personal account" page.
When a document you are watching changes, you get e-mail.

6.1 

Adds a new field to the document entry and display, cross-references. The user
can type in a space or comma separated list of document numbers, which are then
linked to the document display. A list of documents linking to a displayed
document is also shown.

6.0

This version adds support for client certificates and support for changing the
look-and-feel of DocDB with Cascading Style Sheets.

Upgrading to 6.0 is more difficult than usual, but we hope this will give room
to grow. The general steps are:

1. Edit and run scripts/MigrateV6 to expand the SQL database.
2. Update or check out the new CSS files in html/css and put them in place.
3. Edit ProjectRoutines.pm to match the new format. See the .template file
   for examples
4. Very few users will want to upgrade to certificates, so detailed instructions
   for this will come later.   
5. If you have links like "LastModified?days=20" (e.g. in the NavBar) please
   change it to "ListBy?days=20" Also, any ListByType, ListByAuthor,
   ListByTopic links should be changed to just "ListBy" since these routines
   have been consolidated. The old ones are not CSS enabled and will be removed
   in DocDB v 7.0. As a bonus, ListBy is often faster than the routines it
   replaces.
6. Link ListBy to your public site, if you have one.    

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

  DocDB now uses CSS in some places. Expect this use to grow as well as an
  effort to get DocDB generated content to validate under strict XHTML 1.0.
  When updating DocDB, it will probably be necessary to update the CSS files
  too, or things may not render correctly.

  The biggest impact of this is that now the ShowDocument script will not
  render correctly without CSS. To update for CSS, go to $file_root/Static (in
  the standard setup) and do "cvs update -d". This will create a "css"
  directory with the default CSS files for the installation. You can also
  create CSS files just for your project(s) which are included if they exist so
  you can change the DocDB defaults. See ProjectDocDB.css.example for an
  explanation. 

  To accommodate the CSS changes, changes were made to what is expected in 
  ProjectRoutines.pm. DocDB now takes care of loading the default CSS files,
  beginning and ending the <HEAD> and the <BODY> and a few other things. There
  are now three hook routines instead of two:
  
  o ProjectHeader is called at the end of the section of the page between
    <HEAD> and </HEAD> which allows you to include your own CSS (if you don't
    use the mechanism above), Javascript for menus, etc.  
  o ProjectBodyStart is called just after the <BODY> tag and allows you to print
    out a header on the page.
  o ProjectBodyEnd is called just before </BODY> and allows you to print a
    footer on the page.
    
  Take a look at the examples in ProjectRoutines.pm.template. What you used to
  have in DocDBHeader is now expected to be in ProjectHeader and
  ProjectBodyStart, but there are lots of things you don't need either.
  Likewise for DocDBFooter and ProjectBodyEnd. Also, be aware that for pop-ups
  like the keyword chooser, help tips, etc. ProjectHeader will be called, but
  not the other two routines. This allows the style of those windows to be
  consistent with the others without the real estate of headers and
  footers.       

  Finally, CSS may allow us to make generic HTML help files too, since I know
  this is an problem. 
  
Client Certificates
  
  This is a different, more secure method of authenticating users (rather than
  shared group passwords). Access to meta-data and permission to upload files
  requires the user to have a valid client certificate from a CA that you trust.
  The admin interface is used to grant those people membership in the various
  groups in DocDB. Access to files within a document is still controlled by
  group passwords.
  
  For instructions on setting up a web server to use SSL and require client
  certificates, see http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/apache/SSLNotes.html 

5.6.0

New routine to get a report on who needs to sign documents. Linked from various
places. New routine, DocumentTable, to replace DocumentSummary. Has configurable
fields and sort orders, new field added to display next signature needed.

5.5.0

Copying files was not working, so the mechanisms to upload files were scrapped
and completely re-written in a better way. As a consequence, downloading URLs
has been made faster and more secure, but the definition of $WGet has changed in
DocDBGlobals.pm If you changed this in ProjectGlobals.pm, you'll have to change
it to remove all the parameters.

5.4.0

The big change is that in the admin interface, fields that will be ignored based
on the selection of the action (New/Modify/Delete) are greyed out. They are
turned back on as needed. This requires Javascript. Funded by FNAL-CD

There are also the beginnings of an API to allow easier insertation of documents.

5.3.1

Lots of cosmetic changes suggested by FNAL-CD: 

Lists of documents now have project name in the header, not in each document #. 
Completed (I think) the change from E-mail account to personal account.
Add topic -> Add minor topic
Create/edit meeting links are more explicit.
Things that were in blue text are now in the default color. 
Actually styled with class="highlight" which will be a CSS property later.

5.3.0

When updating a document, a user now has the ability to copy files from the
previous document. They can mix uploading some new documents and copying others.
The user will see a checkbox on updating that allows copying the file.

When filling out the new/update document form, the required fields are marked
with an asterisk.

The link to confirm a match between documents and agenda entries has been
changed to a button. This means a web spider won't follow the links and makes it
more clear the user is changing something.


5.2.0

ListManagedDocuments added and a link from the home page. Home page restructured
to add things from ProjectMessages and BTeV/Beams specific code removed.

5.1.3

Send e-mail when a document is approved to everyone who is signed up for
immediate notification and all signers.

5.1.1

To accomodate installations where tar is standard Unix tar (which can't deal
with compressed files) new tar variables have been introduced. $GTar should be
set to GNU's tar (standard tar on Linux). If this doesn't exist, then $Tar
should be set to regular tar and $GZip and $GUnzip to the GNU gzip/gunzip
utilities. The correct defaults for Linux are set in the DocDBGlobals.pm file,
so if you didn't modify these before, you don't need to do anything. If you did
change this and are using GTar, then change your Tar reference to GTar. 

Some groups have requested that by default, new documents are marked as
publically accessible. The variable $DefaultPublicAccess, which defaults to "0"
has been added for this. Change it in ProjectGlobals.pm if you want to have
"Public" selected by default instead of the current user when adding a new
document.

I'm starting a new set of settings to determine which parts of the regular
interface are available to the public. The first part of this is the 
$PublicAccess{MeetingList} variable, set to 0 by default. Set this to 1 if you
want the "all meetings" item to appear on the public home page. If you do this,
you must also create a link to "ListAllMeetings" in your public directory.  

5.1.0

Added new "anyword" and "allword" search modes. Changed keyword link to use
"anyword." 

Added an option for external search routines for document contents, added
template files in scripts/ to give examples on use. You must set the
$ContentSearch variable to turn this option on. Look at
scripts/SearchWrapper.template and scripts/ContentSearch.template for examples
of how BTeV does this using htdig.

4.2.6

Removed execution time from various scripts, should advise people to put in
footer (with version). Example placed in ProjectRoutines.pm
