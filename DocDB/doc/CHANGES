6.3.0 

By default, certificate authorization uses the e-mail address in a client
certificate to determine if it is unique. Some certificate providers don't
encode an e-mail address. In that case, you can set
$Preferences{Security}{Certificates}{UseCNOnly} = TRUE to use the CN instead.

Also, adds indicators of required fields to the meeting entry form and fixes a
few small bugs discovered by FNAL-CD.

6.2 

Allows people with personal accounts to monitor specific documents, not just
based on authors, topics, or keywords. At the bottom of the left column you will
see a place to type your username and password to watch a document. You can
erase the list of watched documents from the "Manage a personal account" page.
When a document you are watching changes, you get e-mail.

6.1 

Adds a new field to the document entry and display, cross-references. The user
can type in a space or comma separated list of document numbers, which are then
linked to the document display. A list of documents linking to a displayed
document is also shown.

6.0

This version adds support for client certificates and support for changing the
look-and-feel of DocDB with Cascading Style Sheets.

Upgrading to 6.0 is more difficult than usual, but we hope this will give room
to grow. The general steps are:

1. Edit and run scripts/MigrateV6 to expand the SQL database.
2. Update or check out the new CSS files in html/css and put them in place.
3. Edit ProjectRoutines.pm to match the new format. See the .template file
   for examples
4. Very few users will want to upgrade to certificates, so detailed instructions
   for this will come later.   
5. If you have links like "LastModified?days=20" (e.g. in the NavBar) please
   change it to "ListBy?days=20" Also, any ListByType, ListByAuthor,
   ListByTopic links should be changed to just "ListBy" since these routines
   have been consolidated. The old ones are not CSS enabled and will be removed
   in DocDB v 7.0. As a bonus, ListBy is often faster than the routines it
   replaces.
6. Link ListBy to your public site, if you have one.    

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

  DocDB now uses CSS in some places. Expect this use to grow as well as an
  effort to get DocDB generated content to validate under strict XHTML 1.0.
  When updating DocDB, it will probably be necessary to update the CSS files
  too, or things may not render correctly.

  The biggest impact of this is that now the ShowDocument script will not
  render correctly without CSS. To update for CSS, go to $file_root/Static (in
  the standard setup) and do "cvs update -d". This will create a "css"
  directory with the default CSS files for the installation. You can also
  create CSS files just for your project(s) which are included if they exist so
  you can change the DocDB defaults. See ProjectDocDB.css.example for an
  explanation. 

  To accommodate the CSS changes, changes were made to what is expected in 
  ProjectRoutines.pm. DocDB now takes care of loading the default CSS files,
  beginning and ending the <HEAD> and the <BODY> and a few other things. There
  are now three hook routines instead of two:
  
  o ProjectHeader is called at the end of the section of the page between
    <HEAD> and </HEAD> which allows you to include your own CSS (if you don't
    use the mechanism above), Javascript for menus, etc.  
  o ProjectBodyStart is called just after the <BODY> tag and allows you to print
    out a header on the page.
  o ProjectBodyEnd is called just before </BODY> and allows you to print a
    footer on the page.
    
  Take a look at the examples in ProjectRoutines.pm.template. What you used to
  have in DocDBHeader is now expected to be in ProjectHeader and
  ProjectBodyStart, but there are lots of things you don't need either.
  Likewise for DocDBFooter and ProjectBodyEnd. Also, be aware that for pop-ups
  like the keyword chooser, help tips, etc. ProjectHeader will be called, but
  not the other two routines. This allows the style of those windows to be
  consistent with the others without the real estate of headers and
  footers.       

  Finally, CSS may allow us to make generic HTML help files too, since I know
  this is an problem. 
  
Client Certificates
  
  This is a different, more secure method of authenticating users (rather than
  shared group passwords). Access to meta-data and permission to upload files
  requires the user to have a valid client certificate from a CA that you trust.
  The admin interface is used to grant those people membership in the various
  groups in DocDB. Access to files within a document is still controlled by
  group passwords.
  
  For instructions on setting up a web server to use SSL and require client
  certificates, see http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/apache/SSLNotes.html 

5.6.0

New routine to get a report on who needs to sign documents. Linked from various
places. New routine, DocumentTable, to replace DocumentSummary. Has configurable
fields and sort orders, new field added to display next signature needed.

5.5.0

Copying files was not working, so the mechanisms to upload files were scrapped
and completely re-written in a better way. As a consequence, downloading URLs
has been made faster and more secure, but the definition of $WGet has changed in
DocDBGlobals.pm If you changed this in ProjectGlobals.pm, you'll have to change
it to remove all the parameters.

5.4.0

The big change is that in the admin interface, fields that will be ignored based
on the selection of the action (New/Modify/Delete) are greyed out. They are
turned back on as needed. This requires Javascript. Funded by FNAL-CD

There are also the beginnings of an API to allow easier insertation of documents.

5.3.1

Lots of cosmetic changes suggested by FNAL-CD: 

Lists of documents now have project name in the header, not in each document #. 
Completed (I think) the change from E-mail account to personal account.
Add topic -> Add minor topic
Create/edit meeting links are more explicit.
Things that were in blue text are now in the default color. 
Actually styled with class="highlight" which will be a CSS property later.

5.3.0

When updating a document, a user now has the ability to copy files from the
previous document. They can mix uploading some new documents and copying others.
The user will see a checkbox on updating that allows copying the file.

When filling out the new/update document form, the required fields are marked
with an asterisk.

The link to confirm a match between documents and agenda entries has been
changed to a button. This means a web spider won't follow the links and makes it
more clear the user is changing something.


5.2.0

ListManagedDocuments added and a link from the home page. Home page restructured
to add things from ProjectMessages and BTeV/Beams specific code removed.

5.1.3

Send e-mail when a document is approved to everyone who is signed up for
immediate notification and all signers.

5.1.1

To accomodate installations where tar is standard Unix tar (which can't deal
with compressed files) new tar variables have been introduced. $GTar should be
set to GNU's tar (standard tar on Linux). If this doesn't exist, then $Tar
should be set to regular tar and $GZip and $GUnzip to the GNU gzip/gunzip
utilities. The correct defaults for Linux are set in the DocDBGlobals.pm file,
so if you didn't modify these before, you don't need to do anything. If you did
change this and are using GTar, then change your Tar reference to GTar. 

Some groups have requested that by default, new documents are marked as
publically accessible. The variable $DefaultPublicAccess, which defaults to "0"
has been added for this. Change it in ProjectGlobals.pm if you want to have
"Public" selected by default instead of the current user when adding a new
document.

I'm starting a new set of settings to determine which parts of the regular
interface are available to the public. The first part of this is the 
$PublicAccess{MeetingList} variable, set to 0 by default. Set this to 1 if you
want the "all meetings" item to appear on the public home page. If you do this,
you must also create a link to "ListAllMeetings" in your public directory.  

5.1.0

Added new "anyword" and "allword" search modes. Changed keyword link to use
"anyword." 

Added an option for external search routines for document contents, added
template files in scripts/ to give examples on use. You must set the
$ContentSearch variable to turn this option on. Look at
scripts/SearchWrapper.template and scripts/ContentSearch.template for examples
of how BTeV does this using htdig.

4.2.6

Removed execution time from various scripts, should advise people to put in
footer (with version). Example placed in ProjectRoutines.pm
