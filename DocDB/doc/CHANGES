CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

  DocDB now uses CSS in some places. Expect this use to grow as well as an
  effort to get DocDB generated content to validate under strict XHTML 1.0.
  When updating DocDB, it will probably be necessary to update the CSS files
  too, or things may not render correctly.

  The biggest impact of this is that now the ShowDocument script will not
  render correctly without CSS. To update for CSS, go to $file_root/Static (in
  the standard setup) and do "cvs update -d". This will create a "css"
  directory with the default CSS files for the installation. You can also
  create CSS files just for your project(s) which are included if they exist so
  you can change the DocDB defaults. See ProjectDocDB.css.example for an
  explanation. 

  To accommodate the CSS changes, changes were made to what is expected in 
  ProjectRoutines.pm. DocDB now takes care of loading the default CSS files,
  beginning and ending the <HEAD> and the <BODY> and a few other things. There
  are now three hook routines instead of two:
  
  o ProjectHeader is called at the end of the section of the page between
    <HEAD> and </HEAD> which allows you to include your own CSS (if you don't
    use the mechanism above), Javascript for menus, etc.  
  o ProjectBodyStart is called just after the <BODY> tag and allows you to print
    out a header on the page.
  o ProjectBodyEnd is called just before </BODY> and allows you to print a
    footer on the page.
    
  Take a look at the examples in ProjectRoutines.pm.template. What you used to
  have in DocDBHeader is now expected to be in ProjectHeader and
  ProjectBodyStart, but there are lots of things you don't need either.
  Likewise for DocDBFooter and ProjectBodyEnd. Also, be aware that for pop-ups
  like the keyword chooser, help tips, etc. ProjectHeader will be called, but
  not the other two routines. This allows the style of those windows to be
  consistent with the others without the real estate of headers and
  footers.       

  Finally, CSS may allow us to make generic HTML help files too, since I know
  this is an problem. 

5.4.0

The big change is that in the admin interface, fields that will be ignored based
on the selection of the action (New/Modify/Delete) are greyed out. They are
turned back on as needed. This requires Javascript. Funded by FNAL-CD

There are also the beginnings of an API to allow easier insertation of documents.

5.3.1

Lots of cosmetic changes suggested by FNAL-CD: 

Lists of documents now have project name in the header, not in each document #. 
Completed (I think) the change from E-mail account to personal account.
Add topic -> Add minor topic
Create/edit meeting links are more explicit.
Things that were in blue text are now in the default color. 
Actually styled with class="highlight" which will be a CSS property later.

5.3.0

When updating a document, a user now has the ability to copy files from the
previous document. They can mix uploading some new documents and copying others.
The user will see a checkbox on updating that allows copying the file.

When filling out the new/update document form, the required fields are marked
with an asterisk.

The link to confirm a match between documents and agenda entries has been
changed to a button. This means a web spider won't follow the links and makes it
more clear the user is changing something.


5.2.0

ListManagedDocuments added and a link from the home page. Home page restructured
to add things from ProjectMessages and BTeV/Beams specific code removed.

5.1.3

Send e-mail when a document is approved to everyone who is signed up for
immediate notification and all signers.

5.1.1

To accomodate installations where tar is standard Unix tar (which can't deal
with compressed files) new tar variables have been introduced. $GTar should be
set to GNU's tar (standard tar on Linux). If this doesn't exist, then $Tar
should be set to regular tar and $GZip and $GUnzip to the GNU gzip/gunzip
utilities. The correct defaults for Linux are set in the DocDBGlobals.pm file,
so if you didn't modify these before, you don't need to do anything. If you did
change this and are using GTar, then change your Tar reference to GTar. 

Some groups have requested that by default, new documents are marked as
publically accessible. The variable $DefaultPublicAccess, which defaults to "0"
has been added for this. Change it in ProjectGlobals.pm if you want to have
"Public" selected by default instead of the current user when adding a new
document.

I'm starting a new set of settings to determine which parts of the regular
interface are available to the public. The first part of this is the 
$PublicAccess{MeetingList} variable, set to 0 by default. Set this to 1 if you
want the "all meetings" item to appear on the public home page. If you do this,
you must also create a link to "ListAllMeetings" in your public directory.  

5.1.0

Added new "anyword" and "allword" search modes. Changed keyword link to use
"anyword." 

Added an option for external search routines for document contents, added
template files in scripts/ to give examples on use. You must set the
$ContentSearch variable to turn this option on. Look at
scripts/SearchWrapper.template and scripts/ContentSearch.template for examples
of how BTeV does this using htdig.

4.2.6

Removed execution time from various scripts, should advise people to put in
footer (with version). Example placed in ProjectRoutines.pm
