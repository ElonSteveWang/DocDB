<center><h1>Identify Resources for DocDB</h1></center>
<p>
   Disk space is needed for the mysql database, DocDB (both cgi and html), 
   and the documents themselves.  The DocDB scripts require about 3 MB.
   At this time, the BTeV document database contains 2500+ documents 
   and uses about 5 MB for the database and 11 GB for the document 
   directory tree.
<p>
   One possible file configuration is: 
   <center>
   <table width="95%">
     <tr>
       <td> cgi scripts
       </td>
       <td> 
       /www/cgi-bin/private/DocDB <br>
       /www/cgi-bin/public/DocDB
       </td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
       <td> MySQL database
       </td>
       <td> /local/mysql
       </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td> document location
       </td>
       <td> /www/html/DocDB
       </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td> html pages
       </td>
       <td> appropriately placed under /www/html/...
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   </center>
<p>
       The public DocDB directory contains links to selected 
       cgi scripts in the private DocDB directory.
  <p>
   Note that the MySQL database is accessed by the cgi scripts but should not 
   live under any web accessable directory.
<p>
   The web server process must be able to write into the document location directory 
   (e.g.,  /www/html/DocDB)
   and this directory must be web viewable.
<p>
   If you want to use the more secure certificate method of granting access, you
   will need to configure and run DocDB under an SSL server. You will also need
   to place DocDB into an area that requires a client-side certificate for
   access. For a primer on setting up Apache in this way, see xxxxx. You will
   also need a way to supply each user with a certificate signed by a CA
   (Certficate Authority) you trust.
<p>
   You should create a document database account to own the
   the DocDB cgi scripts, and the DocDB html files.  
<p>
   You will need an account to own the MySQL database. 
   This can be the  document database account.
   This mysql account will be used to start the MySQL daemon.
   We <b>strongly recommend</b> that the mysql account 
   <b>not</b> be named "mysql".
<p>
   Make sure you have a machine that will support MySQL.
<p>
   The MySQL database can run on any machine.  
   It does not need to reside on the same machine as the web server.
