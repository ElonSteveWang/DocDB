What is the difference between topics and Keywords?
<p>
Keywords are intended as a search mechanism across all documents, but may in
practice apply to only documents within a certain group. Keywords are to
allow quick searches of the database to obtain all documents that are
associated with that keyword. Topics are more of an organizational tool. We
sort the documents into related groups based on their "topic". Both topics
and keywords can be used to find documents.

What is the difference between Keywords and Keyword Groups?
<p>
Keywords can be entered by anyone however, only keywords entered by
administrators show up in the keyword list.  Sorting can only be done on
keywords entered by administrators, but keyword searches will yield results
with keywords entered by users as well as administrators. Keyword groups are
not valid search terms. They have no meaning except to group similar
keywords for the user to be able to more easily identify valid keywords.

Web server configuration?
<p>
Basically, the web server executes the DocDB cgi scripts which make calls to
the MySQL database and place the documents in the appropriate space where
the web server may access them. The searching is done by the MySQL server.
The Web server simply reports the results and downloads the actual document
(compressed) when the user requests it. It does not have to display the
actual documents. We can simply place the DocDB scripts in a directory in
the current web site. The web files reside in AFS space, which is our goal
for the DocDB documents anyway. We would simply need another volume served
by the existing web server.
