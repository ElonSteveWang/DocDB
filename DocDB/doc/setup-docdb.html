<center><h1>Customizing DocDB</h1></center>

<p>
<ol>
<li> <font color="red">Login to the document database account.</font> <br/>
     This account is used to administer the various DocDB scripts and html pages.</li>
<li> Checkout DocDB from CVS as described in <a href="install-docdb.html">the
previous page</a> if you haven't already.</li>
<li> cd to DocDB/cgi
    <ol>
    <li> cp ProjectGlobals.pm.template ProjectGlobals.pm</li>
    <li> cp ProjectMessages.pm.template ProjectMessages.pm</li>
    <li> cp ProjectRoutines.pm.template ProjectRoutines.pm</li>
    <li> cp ProjectHelp.xml.template ProjectHelp.xml</li>
    <li> Edit the global variables in 
	<a href=DocDBGlobals.html>ProjectGlobals.pm</a>. 
	You can also look at DocDBGlobals.pm
	and put new values for those variables in ProjectGlobals.pm.</li> 
    <li> Customized web page headers and footers are defined in  ProjectRoutines.pm.</li>
    <li> If you need a customized keyword message, edit ProjectMessages.pm.</li>
    <li> If you need customized help instructions, edit ProjectHelp.xml</li>
    </ol></li>
<li> Check the files in DocDB/html.</li>
<li> copy the files in DocDB/cgi to $script_root
     (your private DocDB cgi directory) <br/>
     $script_root is defined in ProjectGlobals.pm, 
     it is not an actual environmental variable. (If you installed from the CVS
     repository, you can use the command <tt>cvs update</tt> to update the
     running software here.)</li>
<li>If you are using HTTP Basic Authorization, create a .htaccess file in
    $script_root. If you are using client certificate authorization, you can
    skip this step.<br/>
    Here is a sample .htaccess file:
<pre>
       AuthType Basic
       AuthName "My Document Database"
       AuthUserFile  /somedir/somedir/.htpasswd
       &lt Limit GET POST &gt
       require valid-user
       &lt /Limit &gt
</pre>
     <font color="red">The .htpasswd file should not be in 
     any web-accessable directory.</font> Also, the POST option <font
     color="red">must</font> be present or DocDB will not work (most of the form
     posts to cgi scripts will fail).</li> 
<li> Setup the documentation and Cascading Style Sheets with the command <br/>
     <tt>cp -r DocDB/html  $file_root/Static</tt><br/> 
     where $file_root is defined in ProjectGlobals.pm. </li>
<li> Set permissions on $file_root. 
     <ul>
     <li> $file_root must be owned by the uid/gid of the webserver process.
     DocDB will create the necessary subdirectory structure and populate it
     with the downloaded files when documents are created and edited.
     <li> Unlike the remainder of $file_root, the $file_root/Static directory
     tree must be owned by the document database account.
     </ul></li>
<li> Create the public access scripts. The suggested way to do this is to create
a directory where the relevant scripts (some scripts have no valid public use)
are links to the corresponding private scripts. In this configuration, two
additional files must be present in the public area: ProjectGlobals.pm and
CGIInclude.pm. 
    <ol>
    <li> mkdir /www/cgi-bin/public/DocDB/, chosing an 
         appropriate directory for the public scripts.</li>
    <li> cp DocDB/scripts/PublicInstall.csh /www/cgi-bin/public/DocDB/.</li>
    <li> cp DocDB/cgi/ProjectGlobals.pm /www/cgi-bin/public/DocDB/. <br/>
         This script will make links to the private DocDB cgi area. 
	 Edit this script as necessary.</li>
    <li> Execute PublicInstall.csh.</li>
    <li> rm PublicInstall.csh</li>  
    <li> Edit the public ProjectGlobals.pm, taking particular care 
         to be sure these definitions point <b>ONLY</b> to the 
	 public directories.  Be sure to remove the $Administrator
	 definition from the public ProjectGlobals.pm.  
	 Uncomment the "Public" lines in ProjectGlobals.pm.</li>
    <li> Copy CGIInclude.pm from the scripts/ directory and edit it to point at
         your main installation. This is needed to pick up the DocDB .pm files.</li>
    </ol></li>
<li> mysql SomeDocDB -u docdbadm -p < DocDB/sql/CreateDatabase.SQL </li>
<li>If you are using client certificate based authorization:</li>
 <ol>
  <li>Edit the apache config files to require a client certificate for the
      $cgi_root/$web_root directory. (See <a href=certs.html>SSL and DocDB</a>
      for an explanation of this.)</li>
  <li>Make sure the client certificates you are using are from a CA you trust.</li>
  <li>As the administrator, import your certificate into your web browser if you
      haven't done so.</li>
  <li>Point your web browser at <tt>$web_root/DocumentDatabase</tt>. Follow the
      link to request access and request access in the docdbadm (or DocDBAdm)
      group and whatever other groups you would like to access.</li>
  <li>Now you have to verify that you are an administrator. The easiest way to
      do this is to start mysql in shell mode (<b>mysql -h xxxx -u docdbadm -p
      SomeDocDB</b>), then do the following:<br/>
        <tt>mysql> select  EmailUserID,Name from EmailUser;</tt><br/>
      and find the EmailUserID of the desired administrator (should be "1"
      unless you've done something strange).<br/>
        <tt>mysql> update EmailUser set Verified=1 where EmailUserID=x;</tt><br/> 
      where "x" is the number from the previous step (1).
  <li>Again, point your web browser at    <tt>$web_root/DocumentDatabase</tt>.
      You should no longer see a message indicating that you are need to
      request access. If you follow the "Create or Change Documents..." link,
      you should have access to all adminstration functions.</li>
 </ol></li>
<li> At this point, you can verify that DocDB is running properly. Point your
     web browser at  <tt>$web_root/DocumentDatabase</tt> and log in as
     administrator if necessary. From here you can follow the "Create or Change
     Documents..." link, where you should have access to all adminstrative
     functions. Use the administrator functions to create topics, authors,
     other security groups, etc.</li>
 
<li> mkdir $file_root/Static/Lists</li>
<li> mkdir $file_root/Static/Lists/<em>group-name</em> for every 
     permission group defined in DocDB.</li>
<li> Setup the listing and notification 
     <a href=notification.html>cron jobs</a></li>
<li> Customize CSS files:<br/>The appearance of many pages in DocDB is
     controlled by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). The <tt>.css</tt> files reside
     in <tt>$file_root/Static/css</tt>. The naming scheme is as follows: 
    
     <table cellpadding=3>
       <tr>
        <td>DocDB.css</td>
        <td>The CSS file with global and common settings for all pages.</td>    
       </tr><tr>
        <td>DocDB_IE.css</td>
        <td>Changes to the master setting for Internet Explorer, which has
            broken CSS support.</td>
       </tr><tr>
        <td>DocDBSomeScript.css</td>
        <td>CSS unique to a particular page</td>
       </tr><tr>
        <td>DocDBSomeScript_IE.css</td>
        <td>Changes to the CSS for a page needed by IE</td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     
     To any of these scripts you can make your own changes. Append
     <q>MyProject</q> to the original name of the CSS file and it will be
     included <i>after</i> the DocDB defaults, changing any settings.
     <q>MyProject</q> is what you set $ShortProject to in ProjectGlobals.pm.
     For example, if your project is "Joe" and you want to change the settings
     for the IE only CSS for the ShowDocument page, create a file
     <tt>JoeDocDBShowDocument_IE.css</tt> and place it in the
     <tt>$file_root/Static/css</tt> directory.<p/>
     See <tt>html/css/ProjectDocDB.css.example</tt> for examples of what might
     be changed. Note that not all pages have CSS files and that at this time,
     and that use of CSS in DocDB is new but expanding.</li>
