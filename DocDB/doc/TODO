Use sort by name and sort by topic for lists in event header

add topic and moderator links if they exist to Author and TopicTable

Database structures allow for a number of things that aren't currently supported
by the code:

* Hiding various things from groups (Suppress table)

* Associating an author with personal accounts (AuthorID in EmailUser)

* Restricting who is allowed to sign documents (CanSign in EmailUser)

* Use different URLs for Elsevier journals.
