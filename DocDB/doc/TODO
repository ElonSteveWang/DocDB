Database structures allow for a number of things that aren't currently supported
by the code:

* Notifications on individual documents (EmailDocumentImmediate table)

* Restricting who is allowed to sign documents (CanSign in EmailUser)

* Hiding major topics from groups (GroupTopic table)

* Associating an author with personal accounts (AuthorID in EmailUser)

* Cross referencing documents (DocRevID -> DocumentID allows the target to move
  without being updated.)
