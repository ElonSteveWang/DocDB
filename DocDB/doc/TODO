  implement supress
    view codes: see by default, can see, cannot see
    modify codes: can create with, cannot create with
    
    flag things that don't make sense: cannot see but can create

    find most general rule that applies: 
      can disable rules
      eg view topic:
        (all, group, user) view settings for all topics
        (all, group, user) view settings for top topic
        (all, group, user) view settings for parent topics
        (all, group, user) view settings for particular topic
      authors
	can create with author group (security group with authors)
        can create with that author
      modify events
        (all, group, user) modify all events
        (all, group, user) modify meeting groups
        modify event and view agenda (vs. existence) of event already in place
      create/display ical/rss link
        do above to see if we can display link
        on request, do above again to check if it's OK
        either set group or set groups of user in retrieval, unset after
        on lookup, see if already exists before creating, only create if not public
        creatation should involve a hash of sequence #, DocDB URL, group, email user, key class, type, and key
	  May not need to store URL


    Need for topic, eventgroup, event, keyword group, session (add directly if not present), group
    Also need to put authors into groups
    Option to reduce documents writable by certain group
      Public (only) docs writable by ecal not visible by hcal
    list certificate and security groups in footer

  add multi-field keys
  preserve sig hack
  add authorID link to EmailUserID, need to use this to restrict list of authors
  segmented administration
  check and remove topic(s) on events and sessions

* In using CGI::Untaint, look at as_set for arrays.
HTML::Sanitizer for CGI untaint too. as well as URL

Restore sortByName for authors

Use sort by name and sort by topic for lists in event header

add topic and moderator links if they exist to Author and TopicTable

do show all talks for sessions. have to break and restart the event table (or
embed talk table in big cell in event table?)

Database structures allow for a number of things that aren't currently supported
by the code:

* Hiding various things from groups (Suppress table)

* Associating an author with personal accounts (AuthorID in EmailUser)

* Restricting who is allowed to sign documents (CanSign in EmailUser)

* Use different URLs for Elsevier journals.

* Assigning topics to sessions and events.

* Things like remote location and moderator of an event
