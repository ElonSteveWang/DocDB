Database structures allow for a number of things that aren't currently supported
by the code:

* Hiding major topics from groups (GroupTopic table)

* Associating an author with personal accounts (AuthorID in EmailUser)

* Restricting who is allowed to sign documents (CanSign in EmailUser)

* More info on "Your Account" Page:

1. What groups you have membership in

2. Whether you have sign off privileges

3. What your email notification preferences are

4. Links to changing your email notification preferences (or the capability to change them right there)

* Use different URLs for Elsevier journals. 
  NIMA v465, p 124: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=physics&_method=citationSearch&_urlversion=4&_volkey=01689002%23465%23125%23&_version=1&md5=21c738cf27f2bb1702ab168834569a3d">

* Fix problem with later version not being allowed access to a group, but
earlier versions allowed. (See some remop documents).
