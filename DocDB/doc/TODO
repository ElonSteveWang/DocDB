A lot of adminstration tools should be created to avoid the need to fiddle with
the DB. Currently a lot of the most infrequent stuff, means issuing SQL commands
by hand. The idea would be to get the DB to the point where, aside from the
mysql table, you dump in a single SQL file to populate the DocDB database and
then can do everything else via the web.

* DeleteDocument should be generalized to Delete and allow deletion of 
  authors, topics, institutions, and groups. Or maybe the modification routines
  below should allow deletion.

* DeleteDocument should allow the deletion of a single version of a doc and the
  DB as a whole should deal with situations where a version number is missing. 
  (It probably already does, but should make sure.)
  
* Add/Modify Group to add or modify a group plus all the relevant stuff in
  GroupHierarchy.

* Modify an author (change name or institution). 

* Modify topics (names, parent topic, etc.)

* Add institutions

* Add document types
