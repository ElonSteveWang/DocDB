version 2.x to 3.0

  A number of things have changed starting with version 3.0:
  
     The first step in migration is to redo the database structure. This has to be
  done BEFORE the CGI code is upgraded. A script, MigrateV3, has been
  provided in the  scripts/ directory to make the required changes. Run this
  script first in  init mode: "MigrateV3 --u=username --p=password --a=init"
  where username and password are the MySQL username and password of the
  administrator for the DocDB or the MySQL root user. If your main DocDB
  administrator account is anything other than "docdbadm" you will want to edit
  this script before running it. 
     Run this script again, but this time instead of "init," select "migrate."
  This copies the relevant data into the new DB structure. 
     At this point it is safe to upgrade the CGI code. When you are sure
  everything is working well, you can run the MigrateV3 script again with the
  "--a=delete" option to remove unused data from the DB.
     The things that are changed in this part of the upgrade are:
       o Journal references are moved from the Revision table to a separate
         table.
       o An additional table is created for the enhanced security model
       o The CanAdministrate field is set for the primary admin account
       
       
     The second change that may require user intervention in this upgrade
  relates to the help files. Previously the help text was stored in docdb.hlp.
  Now, there are two files, both of which are XML. DocDBHelp.xml contains the
  default help for DocDB and should not be changed. ProjectHelp.xml contains
  help specific to your project. ProjectHelp.xml.template provides examples of
  how to construct ProjectHelp.xml. In ProjectHelp.xml, you can specify
  additional help that overrides, prepends, or appends to the default help
  text.
  
     The third change regards administration priveledges. Currently the account
  name of the administrator is hard coded and must agree between the SQL DB and
  the wegb/.htaccess users. In the new scheme, the ability to administer is
  stored in the DB itself, so any web/.htaccess account can administer (assuming
  the user knows the MySQL admin name and password.) If the web admin user is
  docdbadm (case insensitive) this is take care of for you. If it is something
  else, you need to edit the MigrateV3 script. 
  
     The v3.0 code does not use this new mechanism, but 3.1 will.    
  
  There are many other things changed in version 3 of DocDB, but those do not
  require intervention. 
  
  Several new configuration variables have been added to DocDB:
    $FirstYear         = 2000;     # Earliest year that documents can be created
    @MeetingMajorTopics    = ("Collaboration Meetings","Other Meetings");
    @ConferenceMajorTopics = ("Conferences");
