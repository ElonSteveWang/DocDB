<center><h1>Common Problems for DocDB</h1></center>
<p>
This page lists various gotchas that we have encountered.
<p>
<ol>
<li> At Fermilab, many Linux machines have a ups perl product installed.
     This product does not contain all the modules required by DocDB.
     The solution has two parts: 
     <ul>
     <li> <b>rm -f /usr/local/bin/*perl* </b>
     <li> make sure that no version of perl is declared current in ups
     </ul>
<li> You may encounter an /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld script which does an
     anonymous ping of mysql.  This fails when you have disabled anonymous 
     access and I have found no way to enable it without embedding a password
     in the script.  The workaround is to disable that part of the script.
     See our sample <a href=mysqld.html>/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld</a> script.
<li> DocDB uses cascading style sheets to set the look and feel of the web pages.
     If you include other style sheets in your project header
     (in ProjectRoutines.pm), these will override the DocDB style sheets and 
     you may need to re-reference your project style sheets.  
     Here is some example code you might want to include in ProjectHeader:
     <pre>
     if ($BrowserCSS eq "_IE") { # Use IE format for including. Hopefully we can not give these to IE7
       print "<!--[if IE]>\n";
       print "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/DocDB/Static/css/BTeVDocDB.css\" type=\"text/css\" />\n";
       print "<![endif]-->\n";
     } else {
       print "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/DocDB/Static/css/BTeVDocDB.css\" type=\"text/css\" />\n";
     }
     </pre>
</ol>
