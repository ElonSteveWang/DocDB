<p>
This page lists various gotchas that we have encountered.
<p>
<ol>
<li> At Fermilab, many Linux machines have a ups perl product installed.
     This product does not contain all the modules required by DocDB.
     The solution has two parts: 
     <ul>
     <li> <b>rm -f /usr/local/bin/*perl* </b>
     <li> make sure that no version of perl is declared current in ups
     </ul>
</ol>
