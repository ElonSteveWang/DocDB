<center><h1>Common Problems for DocDB</h1></center>
<p>
This page lists various gotchas that we have encountered.
<p>
<ol>
<li> At Fermilab, many Linux machines have a ups perl product installed.
     This product does not contain all the modules required by DocDB.
     The solution has two parts: 
     <ul>
     <li> <b>rm -f /usr/local/bin/*perl* </b>
     <li> make sure that no version of perl is declared current in ups
     </ul>
<li> You may encounter an /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld script which does an
     anonymous ping of mysql.  This fails when you have disabled anonymous 
     access and I have found no way to enable it without embedding a password
     in the script.  The workaround is to disable that part of the script.
     See our sample <a href=mysqld.html>/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld</a> script.
</ol>
