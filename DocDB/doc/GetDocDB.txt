DocDB is released often and .tar or .zip files are not usually made.  The best
way to get DocDB is to check out the latest stable version from the CVS
repository into a special account for the document database. Set the
environment variable CVSROOT to
":pserver:anony@docdb.fnal.gov:/local/cvs/doccvs/cvs" (No password or cvs login
is required.  Only DocDB is available in this repository.)

Check out DocDB with the command "cvs co -r stable DocDB"

We strongly recommend that you checkout the 'stable' release The head of the
repository is unstable and likely to cause disfunction.  Other branches of the
code are used only for development purposes.

Updates can be performed with the command "cvs update" while in the same
directory. If you cannot get the software via CVS, please contact the DocDB
maintainers via the users mailing list (docdb-users@fnal.gov) to make
arrangements of if you have questions.
