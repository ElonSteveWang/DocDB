<p>
DocDB is a powerful and flexible document database,
originally designed for use by the BTeV collaboration, 
but now used by other experiments and FNAL divisions.
<p>
The document database consists of three parts: 
a relational database which stores information about the documents, 
a file system hierarchy used for storing the documents themselves, 
and a suite of CGI scripts which provide coherent access 
to both sets of information.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
DocDB maintains a versioned list of documents in a MySQL database.
Information maintained in the database includes, author(s), title, topic(s),
document date, revision number, abstract, keywords, document type, 
pointers to the actual document files, and access restriction information.
<li>
Access to DocDB is controlled by cgi scripts that run on your web server.
<li>
When a document is submitted to DocDB, the document is copied 
(from either local disk or an html address) to a directory located 
on the web server.  Documents may be composed of several files.
<li>
Documents are copied to a central location so that they will not "disappear"
when someone rearranges or deletes files.  This also enables centralized backup.
<li>
Changes to a document result in a new version of the document, 
providing historical archiving.
</ul>
