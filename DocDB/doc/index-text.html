<p>DocDB is a powerful and flexible collaborative document server. It was
originally developed for use by the <a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/">BTeV</a>
collaboration at  <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/">Fermilab</a>  and is now used
by twenty or more other experiments, Fermilab divisions, organizations, national
laboratories, and companies (<a href="http://docdb.fnal.gov/instances.html">a
partial list</a>). DocDB is well suited for managing and sharing documents (not
just official publications) among groups of up to several hundred people.</p>

<p>
A DocDB installation consists of three parts:  1) a relational database which
stores information about the documents,  2) a file system hierarchy used for
storing the documents themselves,  and 3) a suite of CGI scripts which provide
coherent access to both sets of information.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> DocDB maintains a versioned list of documents in a MySQL database.
Information maintained in the database includes, author(s), title, topic(s),
events(s),  creation on modification dates, revision number, abstract,
keywords, document type, pointers to the actual document files, and access
restriction information.</li>
<li> Access to DocDB is controlled by cgi scripts that run on your web
server.</li>
<li> When a document is submitted to DocDB, the document is copied  (from
either local disk or an html address) to a directory located  on the web
server.  Documents may be composed of many files.</li>
<li> Documents are copied to a central location so that they will not
"disappear" when someone rearranges or deletes files.  This also enables
centralized backup.</li>
<li> Changes to a document result in a new version of the document. Old
versions remain available, providing historical archiving. Different versions
allow different access restrictions, so documents can be developed in private
and then <q>released.</q></li>
<li>DocDB contains a robust event and agenda management system which allows
documents to be associated with meetings of all sizes.</li>
</ul>
