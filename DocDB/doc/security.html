<center><h1>DocDB Security Considerations</h1></center>
<p>

Security for DocDB is determined by three sets of permissions:
<ol>
<li>  File level  permissions <br>
      Depending on your installation, these may include both 
      UNIX style permissions and AFS group directory permissions.
<li>  Web permissions
<li>  MySQL permissions
</ol>

<p>
File permissions must be set correctly for the webserver to download 
documents into $file_root.  
See <a href=setup-docdb.html>customizing DocDB</a> for more.
<p>

<h2>DocDB Security Models</h2>

Currently DocDB has two possible security models. You have to pick one for each
instance. (However, two instances may share the same MySQL data and document
files. More on this later.)<p>

<h3>Group based HTTP Basic Authorization</h3>

This is the easiest and simplest method of authorization. You have a number of
<q>groups</q>
which actually correspond to <b>users</b> in the HTTP authorization scheme.
Access to the DocDB scripts is granted to each group with a unique password.
DocDB controls which meta-info is shown to users based on the permissions of the
group. Access to files within documents is controlled by requiring the username
and password for a valid group. You should have at least two groups, one for those uploading and viewing
documents and one for administering the database.<p/>

If you are using an apache webserver, web permissions are controlled 
with the .htaccess file.  The .htaccess file is placed in the DocDB 
cgi-bin diretory.  
See <a href=setup-docdb.html>customizing DocDB</a> for more.
<p>
The htpassword command may be found at:
/afs/fnal.gov/files/expwww/computing/home/docdb/auth/htpasswd/bin/htpasswd.

To create a password file, cd to the directory in which the AuthUserFile
resides (which is specified in the .htaccess file).   Run the following
command:
<ul>
<li>htpasswd/bin/htpasswd -c .xxxpasswd username
</ul>
where username is the name of a read/write user for the xxx instance of
DocDB.
<p>
To add a user to an existing password file, use this command:
<ul>
<li>htpasswd/bin/htpasswd xxxpasswd username
</ul>
 To change the password of an existing user, use the command above.  Users
may be copied and pasted between .xxxpasswd files.
<p>

<h3>Certificate based Authorization</h3>

In this access method, access to DocDB scripts is granted not by a shared group
password, but by an X.509 certificate you import into your web-browser. This
certificate positively identifies you. Each user with a certificate has an
entry, within DocDB, which determines which groups they belong too. While
management of these certificates and user education is an additional work-load,
there are a number of advantages too:
<ul>
 <li>Access can be revoked for a single user without changing a shared group
 password.</li>
 <li>A user can be a member of multiple groups which don't overlap (In DocDB,
 one group can be a sub-group of another, but to get access to documents from
 two different sub-groups without quitting the browser, a user would have to
 know the password for a group that was the <q>master</q> group of both
 sub-groups.</li>
 <li>The user is positively identified and the password cannot be
 <q>sniffed.</q></li>
</ul>
Read access to <b>files</b> within documents is still controlled by shared group
passwords.  

<h3>Multi-mode access</h3>

Each instance must have an access method, but in the same way that you can set
up a public area for publicly accessible documents, you can set up certificate
and HTTP Basic areas. Either one can be made <q>read-only,</q> but in practice
you'd want to set up the HTTP authorization as read-only. This allows you to
require users uploading documents or changing meta-info to be authorized by a
secure certificate, but allows users without a certificate (e.g. travelers
using an Internet Cafe) to have read-only access to the data. 

<h2>Administrators and Groups</h2>

The DocDB administrator (docdbadm in our case) must then log on to the DocDB
instance and add the users created in the .htpasswd file.  These users are
stored in the "SecurityGroups" table of the MySQL database associated with
the DocDB instance.
<p>
Within DocDB groups may be subordinate to other groups.  A dominant group
assumes all the privileges of a subordinate group.  Thus, all groups must be
made subordinate to docdbadm and all local groups are made subordinate to
cdweb.  This is done through the administrative functions of DocDB.
<p>
Never create documents as docdbadm or choose that group when creating
documents.  Only use docdbadm for administrative functions that cannot be
done as cdweb or the instance user.
<p>
Finally, we come to MySQL permissions.
<p>
MySQL maintains its own permissions independent of DocDB, web and file
system permissions.  There are three important accounts for DocDB purposes,
as well as the MySQL root account:
<ol>
  <li> docdbadm - administrative account for a particular document database.
This is the account whose password you must type in DocDB when performing
administrative functions.  It is also used when directly manipulating the
database.
  <li> docdbrw - used for all write functions which modify the database.
  <li> docdbro - used for public access to the database, when modification of
the database is not possible.
</ol>
The "root" account is used to set up new databases and set access
permissions for the other three accounts.

<p>
In MySQL there is a default database named "mysql" which contains the
security information for th edatabase server and each database on that
server.  To use root, you must access the database from localhost only,
meaning using a secure SSH or Telnet connection (Kerberos) to connect to the
machine hosting MySQL (flxd01.fnal.gov).
<p>
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE MYSQL SECURITY SETTINGS UNLESS YOU ARE SURE
ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
<p>
docdbadm may connect to MySQL using a MySQL client from any machine in the
fnal.gov domain.  Nothing outside of this domain is permitted access.  If
you need to use docdbadm from a remote location, you must connect using the
Fermilab VPN.
<p>
docdbrw and docdbro may access the database from any domain.
<p>
The docdbrw and dodbro usernames and passwords are explicitly contained in
the CGI Perl script ProjectGlobals.pm.  This is how the scripts are able to
access the database.
<p>
Docdbadm and its password are NOT in the scripts.  This is why you must type
the administrator password every time you make an administrative change.
<p>
For convenience, the username docdbadm is the same for both the web
interface for DocDB and the MySQL database.  They DO NOT HAVE TO BE THE
SAME.  However, more typing would be required when using the administrator
account.
