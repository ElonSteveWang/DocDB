<title>Road Map for DocDB</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This document lays our a rough road map of where DocDB should be headed in
the next months. As always, this is subject to  modification due to our
needs and the needs of those contracting for improvements.</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>7.0 release</b></li>
 <ul>
  <li>Truly separate meetings and topics. List meetings by MeetingGroup type.</li>
  <li>Delete other listing scripts.</li>
  <li>Split into first/last name, store CN seperately in EmailUsers</li>
  <li>Allow changing of document types</li>
  <li>Fix validation of JS, move JS to files</li>
  <li>Single session meetings (simplified creation).</li>
  <li>CSS for more scripts.</li>
  <li>Drop GroupTopic table</li>
  <li>Calendar functions</li>
 </ul>
 <li><b>Possible in future releases</b></li>
 <ul>
  <li>Use CGI::Pretty</li>
  <li>Allow cross-referencing between instances of DocDB</li>
  <li>Hiding major &amp; minor topics and meetings, doctypes from groups 
  <li>Individual logins with Basic HTTP (rather than groups)</li>
  <li>From Erik Gottschalk:<br/>
      I have a suggestion for the Doc DB. How about a
      meeting-minute template generator. This would generate
      an e-mail message that would serve as a template for
      meeting minutes. It could include a link to the meeting
      in the Doc Db, links to the individual talks, and a field
      that would let someone add comments on any discussion
      that took place during the meeting (or during a particular
      presentation). At the conclusion of the meeting it could
      get mailed (automatically) to the person responsible for
      meeting minutes (or the person who set up the meeting).
      They could then edit the e-mail (adding the minutes), and
      post it back into the document database as a document.
      Anybody who has signed up for receiving new postings
      by e-mail will then receive e-mail telling them about the
      new document, and it will have all the links to the talks
      in case they want to see what they missed.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
