The scripts in this directory are intended as examples of scripts to do project 
specific tasks with DocDB. They are not useful to most people without
modification, but they may be useful to read for those who want to know more
about how DocDB works.

TempleSecure:
 This script did a search on the temple2002 keyword and made sure
 that the "review" user (#5) had access to all such revisions.

BreakMeetings:
 Some groups have used a "meeting" in v6 parlance as a container for series
 of repeating meetings (say once a week). While this sort of worked in v6, this 
 won't work well in v7 (and v7 is much better with handling lots of short
 events than v6 was). So, it is strongly suggested that these series of meetings
 be broken into events.
