/* 
 This is an example of a CSS for a project. 
 The first thing we want to do is change the color of alternating rows and of
 the side bars from very light gray (#eee) to light blue (#ddf). These numbers
 are (#red-green-blue). 
 
 Call this file [Project]DocDB.css where [Project] is the
 same as the $ShortProject variable.
 
 You can also create [Project]DocDB[Script].css files where [Script] is the name
 of a CSS file used just for a particular DocDB script (none exist yet). You can
 also supply *_IE.css to be included just by IE users.
