<b>These are the frequently asked questions about the Document Database (or at
least the ones we feel should be asked frequently).</b><p>


<dl>

<dt><a name="authorentry"><b>Why can't I just type in the name of an author on a document?</b>
<dd>
For technical reasons which are described in
<a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=140">BTeV-doc-140</a>, the names of the authors of a document aren't stored in the
same place as things like the title of the document. Instead, numbers are stored
in the database that link the authors with a particular document. This means
each author of a document must be in the master list of authors <b>before</b>
you can assign them to have written a document. In the future, this master list
will probably be linked with the People Database. Until then, you can 
<a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/AuthorAddForm">add an
author</a> yourself.<p>

 
<dt><a name="addstuff"><b>How do I add a new author? A new topic or subtopic? A new document type.</b>
<dd>
To add a new author, you can either send e-mail to 
<A HREF="mailto:btev-docdb@fnal.gov">btev-docdb@fnal.gov</a> or add the person
yourself with 
<a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/AuthorAddForm">the form</a>.
Please be careful and if you make a mistake, e-mail  
<A HREF="mailto:btev-docdb@fnal.gov">btev-docdb@fnal.gov</a>
rather than trying to fix the mistake.<p>

To have topics or document types added, e-mail  
<A HREF="mailto:btev-docdb@fnal.gov">btev-docdb@fnal.gov</a>. Be prepared to
have your request denied. Having a new document type or major topic added is
hard,  since having too many of these is confusing. Be prepared to argue why the
existing topics or document types don't fit the kind of documents you want to
add. Having a new subtopic added is a little easier, but if you want to organize
things below the subtopic level, use <a href="#keywords">keywords</a>
instead.<p>



<dt><a name="version0"><b>Why are there documents with a "Version 0"</b>
<dd>The 0th version of a document only exists when a document is reserved,
as opposed to being created new. A reserved document usually means one of two
things. Either the author intends to create additional versions but wants a
reference immediately, or the original files from the document have been lost
before the document was migrated into the database.<p>

<dt><a name="missingdoc"><b>Why are some document #'s missing?</b>
<dd>Two possible reasons. First, it could have been deleted because of an entry
error. The information almost certainly exists as another document. Second, the
document might exist but you don't have priveledges to view it.<p>

<dt><a name="deletedoc"><b>How do I delete a document?</b>
<dd>This function is not available to regular users. Send an e-mail to 
<A HREF="mailto:btev-docdb@fnal.gov">btev-docdb@fnal.gov</a> explaining the
situatoin and they will delete the document for you.<p>

<dt><a name="keywords"><b>What are keywords? How do I use them?</b>
<dd>Keywords are really just a text field you can type stuff in, but to make
them useful some conventions have been adopted that you should follow:
<ul>
<li>Be consistent. Re-use old keywords. If your subgroup has a defined set of
keywords, use them.
<li>Keywords are space seperated. Don't use commas. Multi-word keywords should
be joined with an underscore or dash. (Again, be consistent).
<li>Don't use keywords like "pixel." There are topics for that.
</ul><p>
 
<a name="passwords">
<dt><b>Why do I keep having to type in the password?</b>
<dd>
First, you should only have to type in the password one extra time for most
uses. The reason for this is that people other than those in BTeV use the
database too. Currently, this is just the RTES group.<p>

To get technical, because the DocDB can be accessed with more user/password
combinations than just BTeV, the Document Database scripts use a different
authorization realm. The authorization realm for BTeV only documents matches the
realm for the BTeV internal web pages.<p>

However, for documents protected for sub-groups, the realm is different again,
so you will need to type an accepted password again.<p>

Using a web browser that saves passwords, like recent versions of IE, or
Netscape 6 (which can encrypt the passwords with a master password) takes a lot
of the headache out of this process.<p>
 
<a name="subgroups">
<dt><b>Can our sub-group use the DocDB to store documents that aren't accessible
to the rest of the collaboration?</b>
<dd>
Yes. Just ask to have another "group" set up, choose a password, and let the
DocDB administrators know which accounts you want to allow access to your
data.<p>
