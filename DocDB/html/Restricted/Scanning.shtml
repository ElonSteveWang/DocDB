<h2> Using the Scanner on WH9W</a> </h2>
</center>
<p>

If you create handwritten talks or other documents, they can still be placed in
the document database by scanning them to PDF format. These are instructions for
a scanner on WH9W, but should give an idea of how to proceed for those with
scanners at other institutions.<p>

This scanner is located in an alcove near the mailboxes
and across the hall from Dick Adamo's office.

<ol>
<li> Login to the account scan9nw. The password is taped to the machine.
     Apparently normal user accounts do not have the
     right software installed to use the scanner.

<li> Place (first) original face down on the document glass.
   If it is a transparency, back it with a sheet of white
   paper.  There is a white backing on the scanner top
   but using a sheet of paper gives better results.

<li> Start<br>
     -> Programs<br>
       -> Abobe Acrobat<br>
         -> Acrobat 4.0<br>

<li> From the File menu in the Adobe Acrobat window:<br>
      -> Import<br>
        -> Scan<br>
     This will pop up a dialog box; click on "scan".

<li> This will prescan the document which you placed in step 2
   and show the prescan in a new window ( HPPrecision Scan Pro ).<br>
   If desired:<br>
   <ol>
    <LI> use left mouse button to select a rectangular crop area
    <li> adjust sharpness and image type ( color / bw; density .... )
    <li> Zoom to see the cropped area in more detail; this will rescan
       the document.
    </ol>

<li> Put this page into the working document:<br>
   From the HPPrecision Scan Pro window:<br>
   File->Place Image<br>
   When this step is finished it pops up a dialog box with options,
   Next and Done.

<li> If there is nothing more to scan, click on done and go to step 9.

<li> If you wish to scan another page into the same document.<br>
    <ol>
    <li> remove the old original and place a new original on the glass.
    <li> click Next.
    <li> Repeat steps 5, 6 and (7 or 8).  Yes you need to redo the cropping
         on every image.
    </ol>

<li> When you click done, the scanner will stop and you are left in
   an open pdf document.  Browse the document to check that it is
   OK.  If it is not OK, all I know how to do is to start over.
   There are probably smarter things to do if you poke around - 
   <a href=#hints> see the hint below</a>.

<li> Save the document.  In the Adobe Acrobat window:<br>
    File-> Save As.<br>
    Probably just put the file in MyPictures as it suggests.

<li> Exit.    In the Adobe Acrobat window:<br>
    File->Exit.

<li> I usually move the file off of the scanner and onto my
    own machine using a floppy or a zip disk.  You can also
    map your own Wincenter disk space onto the scanner computer
    and copy your file to that space.  To map a newwork drive.<br>
     <ol>
      <li> Right click on "My Computer"
      <li> Select "Map Network drive"
      <li> Fill in the network name of the drive to be mapped.<br>
         It will be something like:<br>
               \\cdserver\username$<br>
            or \\ppdserver\username$<br>
         The $ is important.<br>
         If you log into your own windows account and look at
         MyComputer it should be clear which server is serving your files.
      <li> Click on the: "use different username" option.
         This will prompt you for your wincenter username and password.
      <li> Click on finish.
      <li> Goto the desktop and click on MyComputer.  The network mounted
         drive should be there.  Then drag the file to your own
         file space.
      </ol>
     Don't forget to clean up the MyPictures area in the scanner account
     when you are done.  You can leave files there for a few days if
     you want to make sure that the copy worked before deleting it.

<li> <font color=red> <a name=hints> Hint: </a>  </font>
      if you need to rescan up one or two pages in big document.
     I bet that you do the following, although I have not tried to do it:<br>
       <ol>
       <li> Save the first try at the document.
       <li> Rescan the offending pages and save it as a second document.
       <li> Open the first document using adobe acrobat, delete the
            offending pages and merge the replacement pages in from
            the second file.
       </ol>

</ol>
