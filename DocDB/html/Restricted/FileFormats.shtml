<h2>PowerPoint, Postscript, PDF etc. </h2>
</center>
</p>

<p>At the present time most of our collaborators view the web from a UNIX
platform. This means they cannot view files in formats such as PowerPoint, MS
Word, and Excel. The two file formats that everyone can read are Postscript and
PDF. Please save your presentation in one of these formats <i>as well as</i> in
the native format. This way  your presentation is readable by the entire
collaboration and  the full power of the native format is available to those
who can make use of it, to extract figures for their own use, for example.</p>

<p>To produce PDF files from Microsoft Office (including PowerPoint), the
solution is to print the document using the <q>printer</q> <q>Acrobat
PDFwriter.</q> If you do not have the capability of saving your document or
presentation as PDF you may get an account on the PPD WinCenter 
(<a href="mailto:dcc@fnal.gov">mailto:dcc@fnal.gov</a>) that has the software
to do this.  Adobe, the creator of PDF, has a  
<a href="https://createpdf.adobe.com/index.pl">website</a> (free trial) where
you can upload MS Office documents and get a PDF in return.</p>

<p>PowerPoint also has the option of saving a
presentation as an HTML slideshow. The
Office '97 version of this worked very well, however the more recent versions
of Office '97 have been "improved" and they now generate HTML that is
unreadable by Netscape (versions 4.x or 6.x). <i>Please do not use this option unless you
have a sufficiently old version of PowerPoint</i>. </p>

<p>Also be aware that some PowerPoint fonts do not appear at all in PDF and/or
postscript.  There are other fonts that make unreadable marks on the paper.
There are also fonts that work in one size but not others. Please be careful
about this when starting a PowerPoint document. Try converting a few test pages
to PDF/PS and verify that your choice of font is safe.</p>
