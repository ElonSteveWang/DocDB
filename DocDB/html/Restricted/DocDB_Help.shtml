<h2>Philosophy of the BTeV Document Database</h2>

<h3>Archive vs. Catalog</h3>

While our previous document database was only a method for cataloging
documents, the new database goes one step further; it is also a method for
storing documents in a central location. So, you should never again see a
broken link while looking for the information you want. This distinction is
especially important for archive uploads which are discussed later. <p>

While parts of the interface may look complicated, some options can be
left blank. Omitting a version number will give you the latest version.
Omitting the number of files means "one file." We've tried to simplify the use
of the most common options. Of course, if you have a suggestion on how to make
things easier, please let us know.

<h3>What is a document?</h3>

This may sound like a stupid question, but it's not. People tend to think of a
document as something that consists of writing and can be printed on a piece of
paper. In our context, a document is something much more general. A document is
any piece of information that a) you want to save and b) you want to share with
others. So, a video of a walk-thru of C0 is a document.  A picture of a
photo-tube is a document. A calculation on the back of an envelope and scanned
is a document. (And it's probably a "Note," not a "Figure." The document type
you'll choose later tells what the document <b>is</b> not what format it's
stored in.)

<h2>Entering or updating a document in the database</h2>

<h3>What do you want to do?</h3>

You can add information or documents to the database in five different ways for
five different situations:
<ol>
<li><b>Reserve a document #: </b>You want a number for a document
you are going to write, but don't have a draft of the document.
<li><b>New document: </b>You have a new document ready to be put into the
database. This document has not been entered or reserved before.
<li><b>Update document: </b>You want to upload a new version of a document that is already in the
database. You will also be able to change any of the information in the
database about the document. You must supply a document number to modify.
<li><b>Update database information: </b>The document hasn't changed, but the
information about it has. For example, it's now published so you want to add
that information. You must supply a document number to modify.
<li><b>Add files to document:</b> Perhaps you forgot a file initially, or maybe
now you have a Postscript file to go with the Power Point and PDF files already
present. You can add these files to an existing version of a document. If the
content has changed at all, you should use the Update, not the Add File, option.
</ol>
Select the type of modification appropriate to your situation. 

<h3>Preparing your document for the document database</h3>

If your document just consists of one file, say a PDF, and it is on the computer
you are using or accessible by the web, you are prepared. Better yet, you will
probably be able to use one of the shortcuts in the middle of the page. Skip
ahead to the next section.
<p>
If your document is in several pieces, say a bunch of HTML files or a
PowerPoint, a PDF, and a Postscript, you have a decision to make. Do you want
to specify each file you want to upload or do you want to make everything into
an archive (like a .tar or .zip file) and upload that? In either case, you might
have to use the advanced form in the middle of the Document Database web page.
(The short cuts allow you to upload multiple files if you don't want to choose
any other advanced options.)
<dl>
<dt><h4>Multiple file uploads</h4>

<dd>In our example of a PowerPoint, a PDF, and a Postscript, this is probably
the best choice. When you upload things this way, it might be a little bit more
work, but what the end user will see is usually clearer. To upload your file
this way, select "Multiple files" under "Upload Type" and type the number of
files in your document in the box that says "# of files." The pros of using
this upload method are that you (optionally) get to describe each of your files
in the document and that you don't have to spend time preparing an archive.<p>

When using multiple file upload, you should also understand the concept of Main
and supporting files. Main files are typically the ones you want people to look
at. As an example, the top file of several linked HTML files is a "Main" file,
the others are "Other" files. By default, all files are "Main" files. To mark
additional files as "Other" un-check the appropriate boxes.

<dt><h4>Archive uploads</h4>

<dd>Another way to upload multiple files is to place all the files into an
archive. Currently accepted formats are .tar (Unix tape archives), .tar.gz/.tgz
(compressed .tar files), and .zip (Windows ZIP files). To use this option,
select "Archive Upload" under "Upload Type." When you upload your archive you
will be asked for two additional pieces of information. You will be asked for
the filename of the main file in the archive and to describe that file. Through
that one file, the user should be able to access the other files. For this
reason, this uploaded file should probably be HTML. The pros of this method are
that you don't have to describe or enter every file in the form.

When uploading via archive mode, the Main file will be marked as such and the
entire archive will be marked as an "Other" file.

<dl>
<dt><h5>Note on HTML uploads</h5>

<dd>Remember that the purpose of the document database is to store your
<i>complete</i> document. If you have a number of HTML pages all linked
together, things may appear to "work" just fine if you only upload the first
one. There is no mechanism to prevent you from doing this. However, please
don't do this. Upload all the files so that they <i>all</i> reside on the
server, including images. To
make the links in your HTML work on the server, use links like
<pre>
&lt;a href="myotherpage.html"&gt; or &lt;a href="mysubdir/myotherpage.html"&gt; 
</pre>
rather than 
<pre>
&lt;a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/myotherpage.html"&gt;
</pre>
since in the second form, your document will still point outside of the database
server to files which may disappear.
</dl>

</dl>

<h3>Upload methods</h3>
 
Once your document is prepared, you have one more decision to make. How do you
want to get the file(s) to the document database? You have two choices:

<ol>
<li>You can upload files from your local computer. In this case, you will get
boxes to type the file names into and (probably) a "Browse" button that will
allow you to pick the file from a list. (How this happens depends on your
browser and operating system.) 
<li>You can upload files by supplying a URL. You have to make sure the files
are accessible from the web, but they can be password protected (you will have
to supply the password). You will have to specify the full URL, including the
"http://" or "https://" at the beginning and a filename at the end (you may not
end the URL with "/"). Currently "https://" (secure upload) does not work, but
we hope this will change in the near future.
</ol>

<h3>Filling in the form</h3>

Now that you've decided what you want to do and how you want to get any required
files from your computer into the document database, you've presumably pressed
one of the buttons that lets you add information into the database.<p>

You are now presented with an initially daunting form asking for all kinds of
information about your document. A lot of the fields are required, but some are
optional. You can click on any <font color="red">red link</font> to get a quick
help window that tells you what you are being asked for. Instructions for every
piece of information are not reproduced here, just click on the <font
color="red">red link</font> if anything is not obvious.<p>

Also, note that lots of things can have more than one selection. For
instance, your document can have several topics selected. How this is done
varies by browser. Internet Explorer and Netscape 6 users should hold Ctrl and
click to make multiple selections. Netscape 4 users should just click.<p>

When <b>reserving</b> a document, you must supply:
<ul>
 <li>A title 
 <li>A requester (who is requesting the document?)
 <li>A document type (talk, note, etc.)
</ul>

When <b>adding</b> a new document, you must supply all of the above plus:
<ul>
 <li>An abstract
 <li>Authors (one required, multiples OK)
 <li>Topics (one required, multiples OK)
 <li>At least one file 
</ul> 
and optionally:
<ul>
 <li>A note explaining any publication information
 <li>A journal reference
 <li>Security settings (blank is the same as public, multiples OK)
</ul>

When <b>updating</b> a document, you can change all the information above.
However, all the forms should be pre-filled for you with the information from
the previous version. You will have to supply <i>all</i> the files you want to
be in the new version, though.<p>

Finally, <b>updating the database information</b> about the document is the same
as updating the document except for two things. First, you can't supply new
files. Second, a new version number <i>is not</i> created. 

<h3>Other options</h3>
 
The advanced form provides a few other options that might be useful.  

<p>
<b>Topic Selection: </b>
You can either select the subtopic(s) for your document from one long list (the
current default) or from a number of shorter lists split up by topic. 

<p>
<b>Author Selection: </b>
You can either select the author(s) for your document from a long list (the
default) or by typing the author list into a text box. Using the second method,
each author is checked against the master list and placing the document in the
database will not proceed until every author you've typed in has a unique match.
You can type in full first names or just initials, the matching is
<i>reasonably</i> intelligent. 

<p>
<b>Overriding the submission date: </b>
Use this option to set the date and time for a document written in the past.
Unless you are submitting a document from the old database or one written 
some time ago, you should probably not select this option. By default, new documents
are entered with the current date and time.

<h2>Special Cases</h2>

<a name="meeting">
<h3>Group meeting talks</h3>

A group meeting talk can be entered into the database using the normal entry
form, just make sure you choose the appropriate meeting date as one of the
topics for your talk. <p>

However, to simplify the addition of a meeting talk into the database, a  
<a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/DocumentAddForm?special=meeting">simplified
addition form</a> has been designed. (It's available from the meetings page.)
This form pre-selects the nearest meeting, the talk type and eliminates the
choices for publication information and authors. The author is automatically set
to the requester. If this is too limiting, you'll have to use the regular entry
form.<p>

On this reduced form, all the information is required (including an abstract of
some sort). As always, you can click
on any <font color="red">red link</font> to get a quick help window that tells
you what you are being asked for. <p>

Since this will be a lot of people's first experience with adding a document
into the document database, a little explanation is in order.<p>

<b>Title</b> and <b>Abstract</b> should be obvious. One suggestion: it's better
if you don't hit "Enter" in the abstract box unless you want to break a line or
paragraph.<p>

<b>File upload boxes:</b> Click "Browse" and use your operating systems file picker to
select the files (PPT, PS, PDF, etc.) for your talk. You can leave boxes blank
if you don't have as many files as you are being asked for, but you must fill in
the first one. You should probably just leave the box marked "Main" checked.
Finally, you can enter a short description of each file. This is helpful for
people looking at the talk. A description like "PDF File" will be
appreciated.<p>

<b>Requester:</b> Find and select the name of the person giving the talk. (This
is probably you.)<p>

<b>Security:</b> BTeV should be checked and shouldn't be changed unless you
really want to make your document public.<p>

<b>Topics:</b> The various sub-topic are broken out into groups based on the
main topic. You should select at least one topic in addition to the meeting
(which should be pre-selected). You can select an arbitrary number from one or
more of the boxes. Just click or Ctrl-click to add topics to the list.<p>

That's it, you are done. Hit "Submit Document." If everything goes well, you'll
get a message saying that and a preview of what your entry looks like in the
database. If things don't go well, you will get (we hope) helpful messages
explaining the problem(s).<p>

<a name="conference">
<h3>Conference Talks and Proceedings</h3>

Conference documents are added just like any other document, except for two
things. First, you probably need to 
<a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/ConferenceAddForm">add some
information</a> into the database about your conference. Do this by following
the link at the bottom of the 
<a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/DocumentDatabase">main page</a>.
But before you add it, make sure someone else didn't already do it for you. (At
the bottom of the add form is the list of conferences the database knows
about).<p>

Second, when adding your document, make sure that one of the topics you select
is the topic corresponding to your conference. This way your document is
associated with the right conference.

<a name="reference">
<h3>Publications in Refereed Journals</h3>

Below the free-form "Publication Information" field is a place to select a
journal, volume, and page for your document if it is published. If you need a
journal added, let the database administrators know.




<h2>Final Words</h2>

<h3>Referring to your document</h3>

To refer to your document use the form <b>BTeV-doc-XXXX</b> where XXXX is the document
number (1 to 6 digits). You can also use the form <b>BTeV-doc-XXXX-vXX</b> to refer to
a specific version of a document. The <b>BTeV-doc-XXXX</b> form refers to the
latest version.

You can also construct URL's that link to your document. The URL is of the form
<tt>http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=XXXX&amp;version=XX</tt>,
where the X's represent <i>just the numbers</i> of the document and version.
(I.e. leave off the ``BTeV-doc-'' and ``-v.'') As above, you can leave off the
<tt>&amp;version=XX</tt> to refer to the latest version.

<h3>Getting more help</h3>

You can often get more help when using the entry form or the advanced forms on
the main page by clicking on the <font color="red">red terms</font> on the
page. A small window will pop up to explain what is going on.<p>

If you have additional questions, suggestions, or problems with the document
database, please send e-mail to the <a href="mailto:btev-docdb@fnal.gov">DocDB
