<h2>A. Philosophy of the Document Database</h2>

<a name="archive">
<h3>1. Archive vs. Catalog</h3>

While our previous document database was only a method for cataloging
documents, the new database goes one step further; it is also a method for
storing documents in a central location. So, you should never again see a
broken link while looking for the information you want. This distinction is
especially important for archive uploads which are discussed later. <p>

While parts of the interface may look complicated, some options can be
left blank. Omitting a version number will give you the latest version.
Omitting the number of files means "one file." We've tried to simplify the use
of the most common options. Of course, if you have a suggestion on how to make
things easier, please let us know.

<a name="whatis">
<h3>2. What is a document?</h3>

This may sound like a stupid question, but it's not. People tend to think of a
document as something that consists of writing and can be printed on a piece of
paper. In our context, a document is something much more general. A document is
any piece of information that a) you want to save and b) you want to share with
others. So, a video of a walk-thru of C0 is a document.  A picture of a
photo-tube is a document. A calculation on the back of an envelope and scanned
is a document. (And it's probably a "Note," not a "Figure." The document type
you'll choose later tells what the document <b>is</b> not what format it's
stored in.)<p>

<a name="formats">
<h3>3. File formats (PowerPoint, Postscript, PDF etc.)</h3>


Many of our collaborators view the web from a UNIX platform. This means they
cannot view files in formats such as PowerPoint, MS Word, and Excel. The two
file formats that everyone can read are Postscript and PDF. PDF is easiest for
Windows users.  Please save your
document in one of these formats as well as in the native format. (If your
document is in Latex, you are encouraged to place that in the database as well.)<p>

If you do not have the capability of saving your Windows formatted documents as PDF
you may get an account on the PPD WinCenter (E-mail <a
href="mailto:dcc@fnal.gov">dcc@fnal.gov</a>) that has the
software to do this.  To create a PDF file from PowerPoint, print the document
using "Acrobat PDFwriter" as your printer (this creates a PDF file).<p>

Also be aware that some Windows or PowerPoint fonts do not appear at all in
PDF and/or postscript.  There are other fonts that make unreadable marks on
the paper.  There are also fonts that work in one size but not others.  Please
be careful about this when starting a PowerPoint document.  Try converting a
few test pages to PDF/PS and verify that your choice of font is safe.<p>

(<a href=mailto:"kutschke@fnal.gov">kutschke@fnal.gov</a>.)<p>

<a name="entering">
<h2>B. Entering or updating a document in the database</h2>

<a name="modtypes">
<h3>1. What do you want to do?</h3>

You can add information or documents to the database in five different ways for
five different situations:
<ol>
<li><b>Reserve a document #: </b>You want a number for a document
you are going to write, but don't have a draft of the document.
<li><b>New document: </b>You have a new document ready to be put into the
database. This document has not been entered or reserved before.
<li><b>Update document: </b>You want to upload a new version of a document that is already in the
database. You will also be able to change any of the information in the
database about the document. You must supply a document number to modify.
<li><b>Update database information: </b>The document hasn't changed, but the
information about it has. For example, it's now published so you want to add
that information. You must supply a document number to modify.
<li><b>Add files to document:</b> Perhaps you forgot a file initially, or maybe
now you have a Postscript file to go with the Power Point and PDF files already
present. You can add these files to an existing version of a document. If the
content has changed at all, you should use the Update, not the Add File, option.
</ol>
Select the type of modification appropriate to your situation. 

<a name="prepare">
<h3>2. Preparing your document for the document database</h3>

If your document just consists of one file, say a PDF, and it is on the computer
you are using or accessible by the web, you are prepared. Better yet, you will
probably be able to use one of the shortcuts in the middle of the page. Skip
ahead to the next section.
<p>
If your document is in several pieces, say a bunch of HTML files or a
PowerPoint, a PDF, and a Postscript, you have a decision to make. Do you want
to specify each file you want to upload or do you want to make everything into
an archive (like a .tar or .zip file) and upload that? In either case, you might
have to use the advanced form in the middle of the Document Database web page.
(The short cuts allow you to upload multiple files if you don't want to choose
any other advanced options.)
<dl>
<dt><h4>a. Multiple file uploads</h4>

<dd>In our example of a PowerPoint, a PDF, and a Postscript, this is probably
the best choice. When you upload things this way, it might be a little bit more
work, but what the end user will see is usually clearer. To upload your file
this way, select "Multiple files" under "Upload Type" and type the number of
files in your document in the box that says "# of files." The pros of using
this upload method are that you (optionally) get to describe each of your files
in the document and that you don't have to spend time preparing an archive.<p>

When using multiple file upload, you should also understand the concept of Main
and supporting files. Main files are typically the ones you want people to look
at. As an example, the top file of several linked HTML files is a "Main" file,
the others are "Other" files. By default, all files are "Main" files. To mark
additional files as "Other" un-check the appropriate boxes.

<dt><h4>b. Archive uploads</h4>

<dd>Another way to upload multiple files is to place all the files into an
archive. Currently accepted formats are .tar (Unix tape archives), .tar.gz/.tgz
(compressed .tar files), and .zip (Windows ZIP files). To use this option,
select "Archive Upload" under "Upload Type." When you upload your archive you
will be asked for two additional pieces of information. You will be asked for
the filename of the main file in the archive and to describe that file. Through
that one file, the user should be able to access the other files. For this
reason, this uploaded file should probably be HTML. The pros of this method are
that you don't have to describe or enter every file in the form.

When uploading via archive mode, the Main file will be marked as such and the
entire archive will be marked as an "Other" file.

<dl>
<dt><h5>Note on HTML uploads</h5>

<dd>Remember that the purpose of the document database is to store your
<i>complete</i> document. If you have a number of HTML pages all linked
together, things may appear to "work" just fine if you only upload the first
one. There is no mechanism to prevent you from doing this. However, please
don't do this. Upload all the files so that they <i>all</i> reside on the
server, including images. To
make the links in your HTML work on the server, use links like
<pre>
&lt;a href="myotherpage.html"&gt; or &lt;a href="mysubdir/myotherpage.html"&gt; 
</pre>
rather than 
<pre>
&lt;a href="http://www-btev.fnal.gov/myotherpage.html"&gt;
</pre>
since in the second form, your document will still point outside of the database
server to files which may disappear.
</dl>

</dl>

<a name="upload">
<h3>3. Upload methods</h3>
 
Once your document is prepared, you have one more decision to make. How do you
want to get the file(s) to the document database? You have two choices:

<ol>
<li>You can upload files from your local computer. In this case, you will get
boxes to type the file names into and (probably) a "Browse" button that will
allow you to pick the file from a list. (How this happens depends on your
browser and operating system.) 
<li>You can upload files by supplying a URL. You have to make sure the files
are accessible from the web, but they can be password protected (you will have
to supply the password). You will have to specify the full URL, including the
"http://" or "https://" at the beginning and a filename at the end (you may not
end the URL with "/"). Currently "https://" (secure upload) does not work, but
we hope this will change in the near future.
</ol>

<a name="filling">
<h3>4. Filling in the form</h3>

Now that you've decided what you want to do and how you want to get any required
files from your computer into the document database, you've presumably pressed
one of the buttons that lets you add information into the database.<p>

You are now presented with an initially daunting form asking for all kinds of
information about your document. A lot of the fields are required, but some are
optional. You can click on any <font color="red">red link</font> to get a quick
help window that tells you what you are being asked for. Instructions for every
piece of information are not reproduced here, just click on the <font
color="red">red link</font> if anything is not obvious.<p>

Also, note that lots of things can have more than one selection. For instance,
your document can have several topics selected. How this is done varies by
browser; some browsers require holding Ctrl and clicking to make multiple
selections, others just click to select and deselect.<p>

When <b>reserving</b> a document, you must supply:
<ul>
 <li>A title 
 <li>A requester (who is requesting the document?)
 <li>A document type (talk, note, etc.)
</ul><p>

When <b>adding</b> a new document, you must supply all of the above plus:
<ul>
 <li>An abstract
 <li>Authors (one required, multiples OK)
 <li>Topics (one required, multiples OK)
 <li>At least one file 
</ul> 
and optionally:
<ul>
 <li>Keywords: These can be anything, but check with your group and/or subgroups
     as standards may exist.
 <li>A note explaining any publication information
 <li>A journal reference (you can add more later)
 <li>Security settings (blank is the same as public, multiples OK)
</ul><p>

When <b>updating</b> a document, you can change all the information above.
However, all the forms should be pre-filled for you with the information from
the previous version. You will have to supply <i>all</i> the files you want to
be in the new version, though.<p>

Finally, <b>updating the database information</b> about the document is the same
as updating the document except for two things. First, you can't supply new
files. Second, a new version number <i>is not</i> created.<p>

<a name="advanced">
<h3>5. Advanced options</h3>
 
The advanced form provides a few other options that might be useful.<p> 

<b>Topic Selection: </b>
You can either select the subtopic(s) for your document from a number of
shorter lists split up by topic (the current default) or from one long
list.<p> 

<b>Author Selection: </b> You can either select the author(s) for your document
from a long list (the default) or by typing the author list into a text box.
Using the second method, each author is checked against the master list and the
document will not be placed in the database until every author you've typed in
has a unique match. You can type in full first names or first initials (middle initials
are ignored), the matching is <i>reasonably</i> intelligent.<p>

<b>Overriding the submission date: </b> Using this option will give you another
control on the entry form to set the date and time for a document written in
the past. Unless you are submitting a document from the old database or one
written  some time ago, you should probably not select this option. By default,
new documents are entered with the current date and time.<p>

<a name="special">
<h2>C. Special Cases</h2>

<a name="meeting">
<h3>1. Group Meeting Talks</h3>

A group meeting talk can be entered into the database using the normal entry
form, just make sure you choose the appropriate meeting date as one of the
topics for your talk. <p>

However, to simplify the addition of a meeting talk into the database, a  
<a href="/cgi-bin/DocDB/DocumentAddForm?special=meeting">simplified
addition form</a> has been designed. (It's also available from the meetings page.)
This form pre-selects the nearest meeting, the talk type and eliminates the
choices for publication information and authors. The author is automatically set
to the requester. If this is too limiting, you'll have to use the regular entry
form.<p>

On this reduced form, all the information is required (including an abstract of
some sort). As always, you can click
on any <font color="red">red link</font> to get a quick help window that tells
you what you are being asked for. <p>

Since this will be a lot of people's first experience with adding a document
into the document database, a little explanation is in order.<p>

<b>Title</b> and <b>Abstract</b> should be obvious. One suggestion: it's better
if you don't hit "Enter" in the abstract box unless you want to break a line or
paragraph.<p>

<b>File upload boxes:</b> Click "Browse" and use your operating systems file picker to
select the files (PPT, PS, PDF, etc.) for your talk. You can leave boxes blank
if you don't have as many files as you are being asked for, but you must fill in
the first one. You should probably just leave the box marked "Main" checked.
Finally, you should enter a short description of each file. This is helpful for
people looking at the talk. A description like "PDF File" will be
appreciated. If you need more than 3 input boxes, you should use links from the 
<a href="/cgi-bin/DocDB/DocumentDatabase">main page</a>.
(If speakers commonly need additional upload boxes, we can add more to this
page.)<p>

Remember that we need companion Postscript or PDF for PowerPoint talks.<p>

<b>Requester:</b> Find and select the name of the person giving the talk. (This
is probably you.)<p>

<b>Security:</b> BTeV should be checked and shouldn't be changed unless you
really want to make your document public.<p>

<b>Topics:</b> The various sub-topic are broken out into groups based on the
main topic. You should select at least one topic in addition to the meeting
(which should be pre-selected). You can select an arbitrary number from one or
more of the boxes. Just click or Ctrl-click to add topics to the list.<p>

That's it, you are done. Hit "Submit Document." If everything goes well, you'll
get a message saying that and a preview of what your entry looks like in the
database. If things don't go well, you will get (we hope) helpful messages
explaining the problem(s).<p>

If for some reason you need more options that this short form gives you, use 
a regular document entry form available from the 
<a href="/DocDB/DocumentDatabase">DocDB main 
page</a>, making sure to select the right meeting as one of your topics.<p>

<a name="conference">
<h3>2. Conference Talks and Proceedings</h3>

Conference documents are added just like any other document, except for two
things. First, you probably need to 
<a href="/cgi-bin/DocDB/ConferenceAddForm">add some
information</a> into the database about your conference. Do this by following
the link at the bottom of the 
<a href="/cgi-bin/DocDB/DocumentDatabase">main page</a>.
But before you add it, make sure someone else didn't already do it for you. (At
the bottom of the add form is the list of conferences the database knows
about).<p>

Second, when adding your document, make sure that one of the topics you select
is the topic corresponding to your conference. This way your document is
associated with the right conference.<p>

<a name="reference">
<h3>3. Publications in Refereed Journals</h3>

Below the free-form "Publication Information" field is a place to select a
journal, volume, and page for your document if it is published. If you need a
journal added, let the database administrators know.<p>

<h2>D. Preferences and E-mail Notification</h2>

<a name="prefs">
<h3>Setting preferences</h3>

Setting preferences with the Document Database allows you to configure the
default entry
forms to your liking and to save some typing by telling the database who you
are. <p>

Once the database knows who you are, your name will be pre-selected as the requester and
author of new documents. You can, of course, change this setting to enter
documents by people other than (or in addition to) yourself.<p>

You can also set your document entry preferences, so for instance if you often
find yourself submitting URLs instead of files, you may wish to select HTTP
submission as your default file submission method. You can always use the
<q>Customized Insert/Modify</q> form to over-ride any preferences.<p>

To set your preferences, follow the link from the main Document Database page.
Also, make sure your browser will accept cookies, at least for the BTeV web
server.

<a name="email">
<h3>Setting e-mail notification</h3>

By following the link for "E-mail Notification" from the main page, you can
request to be notified of new documents or documents that change. You are
notified only for documents on topics that you select. You can choose to be
notified immediately, once a day, and/or once a week. For each time period, you
can choose which documents to be notified about. So, for instance, you could
choose to be notified immediately if a new document is created about your
detector and every week about all new documents in the database. 

<a name="final">
<h2>E. Final Words</h2>

<a name="refer">
<h3>Referring to Your Document and Files</h3>

To refer to your document use the form <b>BTeV-doc-XXXX</b> where XXXX is the document
number (1 to 6 digits). You can also use the form <b>BTeV-doc-XXXX-vXX</b> to refer to
a specific version of a document. The <b>BTeV-doc-XXXX</b> form refers to the
latest version.<p>

<h4>Linking to your document</h4>

You can also construct URL's that link to your document. The URL is of the form
<tt>http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=XXXX&amp;version=XX</tt>,
where the X's represent <i>just the numbers</i> of the document and version.
(I.e. leave off the ``BTeV-doc-'' and ``-v.'') As above, you can leave off the
<tt>&amp;version=XX</tt> to refer to the latest version.<p>

<b>Using "as of" instead of version number:</b>: Instead of specifying a version
number, you can specify <tt>&asof=2002-12-25</tt> which will give you the
version of this document current as of December 25, 2002. 

<h4>Linking to files in a document</h4>

Each file for each revision has a static URL which can easily be found. However,
often times linking to a file that may be updated is what is wanted. For that
case, there is a script interface which fetches files. The URL is 
<tt>http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/RetrieveFile?docid=XXXX&amp;version=XX&amp;filename=xxxxxx</tt>.
The version number can be left off to get files from the latest version number.
The filename can also be left off. If there is only one file marked <q>Main</q>
that file will be retrieved. 
An alternate form is
<tt>http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/DocDB/RetrieveFile?docid=XXXX&amp;version=XX&amp;extension=xxx</tt>,
so for instance you can specify PDF as the extension to retrieve the PDF file
for a document. As above, <tt>version</tt> can be left off or <tt>asof</tt> can
be specified.
If your request matches no files or more than one file, the full document
information will be shown and the user will have to choose the correct file.<p>

For both of these actions, if you want the result to be publicly accessible,
put "public" between "cgi-bin" and "DocDB".  I.e. use
<tt>http://www-btev.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/public/DocDB/ShowDocument</tt> instead of
the normal version. The document must also be publicly accessible for this to
work.

<a name="morehelp">
<h3>Getting More Help</h3>

You can often get more help when using the entry form or the advanced forms on
the main page by clicking on the <font color="red">red terms</font> on the
page. A small window will pop up to explain what is going on.<p>
